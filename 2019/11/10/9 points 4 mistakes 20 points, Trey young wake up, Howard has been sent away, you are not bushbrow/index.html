        <p>In a game that ended today, the Bulls beat the eagles 113-93 away by 20 points. The Hawks returned to trejan’s single core team again, as Thompson Collins next to him continued to be banned from the league. Like Aton, Collins is also applying to the League for a 25 match ban reduction.<br>We don’t know whether it will pass or not, but now the eagle is on the brink of extinction. Trejan needs to play better if they want to make it to the playoffs this season. Today’s performance of 3 out of 12 with only 9 points and 4 mistakes is unable to lead the team further.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2019/11/10/9%20points%204%20mistakes%2020%20points,%20Trey%20young%20wake%20up,%20Howard%20has%20been%20sent%20away,%20you%20are%20not%20bushbrow/5d41aa59acf6468ab4a252e41f62c773.jpg" alt="9 points 4 mistakes 20 points, Trey young wake up, Howard has been sent away, you are not bushbrow"><br>But the bulls are really good. They just pushed the Lakers to the brink yesterday, once leading by 17 points. By the end of the third quarter, the Lakers were 13 points behind. But in the last quarter, the Lakers played a wave of 16-0 anti super under the leadership of Kuzma + Howard + cook. Davis, like today’s trejan, didn’t perform well in that game. Basically, the Lakers only relied on LeBron James to keep the difference in the first half.<br>And the key to the Lakers’ final turnaround is that they have Howard, who has an incredible performance on the defensive side. Howard is like a shield, Kuzma is like a spear.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2019/11/10/9%20points%204%20mistakes%2020%20points,%20Trey%20young%20wake%20up,%20Howard%20has%20been%20sent%20away,%20you%20are%20not%20bushbrow/92a075ea3abc4322a15a33baa973f080.jpg" alt="9 points 4 mistakes 20 points, Trey young wake up, Howard has been sent away, you are not bushbrow"><br>Hawks used to have Howard, but they’ve already sent him away. If the eagles had Howard today, they might have a chance at the end of the day. It’s a pity that the eagles didn’t defend well at the end of the season. It’s hard to fight back. Trey young is not a big brow Davis, in Davis’s downturn, he has James and a group of teammates. Trejan can’t make mistakes. He has to break out every time.<br>Today’s game is really tough, the first quarter and the Lakers. The Bulls started off with a fierce attack, and marcanin continued to score. Satolanski also kept winning, while the Hawks only got three points in the old kart’s life to respond. Trey young scored a 2 + 1, which was the most brilliant goal of Trey Young’s game. The Bulls led by 14 points in the first quarter, 33-19.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2019/11/10/9%20points%204%20mistakes%2020%20points,%20Trey%20young%20wake%20up,%20Howard%20has%20been%20sent%20away,%20you%20are%20not%20bushbrow/158980119ff24e3e8f477456acbceedb.jpg" alt="9 points 4 mistakes 20 points, Trey young wake up, Howard has been sent away, you are not bushbrow"><br>In the second quarter, the bull’s offensive did not decrease. Markanin raised his hand to hit three points at the beginning of the game, and the difference was opened to 17 points. Then the Hawks made a 7-0 approach. But the bulls can always respond, with the Bulls still leading 15 points 56-41 at half-time. In the second half, the bulls were crazy. Raven scored two points with the ball. Marcanin hit three points again. Porter and satolanski even scored 10 points. The bulls have gained a 26 point lead.<br>At this time the familiar script appeared, Trey young layup to help the eagles to stabilize the situation. It’s when everyone’s expecting the eagles to turn around like the Lakers at the end of the season.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2019/11/10/9%20points%204%20mistakes%2020%20points,%20Trey%20young%20wake%20up,%20Howard%20has%20been%20sent%20away,%20you%20are%20not%20bushbrow/79c0ef7cc3cc44de9d956ae76be74343.jpg" alt="9 points 4 mistakes 20 points, Trey young wake up, Howard has been sent away, you are not bushbrow"><br>The eagles couldn’t stop the bulls at the end of the season. They started with a wave of 10-3 to show hope. But the Hawks lack the internal defense gate, which makes the Bulls blossom inside and outside. The difference between the two points is not easy to get close to 20 points, and it is pulled back to 27 points.<br>After today’s game, trejan apologized publicly: “I want to praise the performance of the opponents. They play hard and they play back-to-back. They’ve just been turned around by the Lakers, but today they don’t lose their sense of energy. As a young team, we are not as good as our opponents. I need to be responsible. I need to learn. Because no one will sympathize with us, losing is losing<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2019/11/10/9%20points%204%20mistakes%2020%20points,%20Trey%20young%20wake%20up,%20Howard%20has%20been%20sent%20away,%20you%20are%20not%20bushbrow/e49b19a1af78495698f49fec12462f92.jpg" alt="9 points 4 mistakes 20 points, Trey young wake up, Howard has been sent away, you are not bushbrow"><br>29 minutes, 12 shots, 3 shots, 9 points, 3 rebounds, 3 assists, plus or minus - 16. Trejan must be right to take responsibility. The eagle needs him to kill everywhere.</p>
