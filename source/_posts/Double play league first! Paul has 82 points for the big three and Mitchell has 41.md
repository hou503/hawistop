The Suns do have some restraint. Conley is 5 in 16 and 1 in 7. Every time Conley meets Paul, he is severely restricted and has no shooting space at all. Mitchell feels hot and tries his best, but this is not enough. Boyang is only 1 in 8 outside the three-point line today. The three-point goal that jazz are proud of this season is not on-line. The most embarrassing thing is that jazz do not have an advantage over the Suns either in the back line or inside line. The Suns' overall defense is not inferior to jazz. Two teams really meet in the playoffs, jazz difficult to pass.

According to the analysis of NBA salary experts, Paul helped the team complete the qualitative change after he came to the suns. During the off-season, Paul has player options, and the Suns can extend his contract with him for at most two years in advance until the summer of 2024. If the Suns choose to renew his contract with top salary, Paul's salary in the next three years will be $44.2 million, $40.5 million and $43.73 million respectively. According to Paul's ability to lead the team, is he worth the price? There's another way, Paul chooses to join a championship level team when his contract expires next summer, trying to get a championship ring at the end of his career, such as the nets or the Lakers?
