This season, the competition in the East is extremely fierce. The top three 76ers, the nets and the bucks are competing for the first place. The nets and the 76ers have been competing for the first place, and the bucks are also eyeing. From the fourth hawks to the eighth Celtic, there has been no gap. After the Lakers won the championship last season, a number of teams in the eastern region recruited. It seems that they all like the way the heat reached the finals last season, so that the eastern region is now in dire straits. The nets, needless to say, have a combination of Durant + Owen + harden + Adelaide + Griffin, and the strength of the role players is not poor. The bucks are also deploying troops for the letter brother, and the 76 people finally no longer believe in the process and bear fruit.

Up to now, the 76ers are 35-16, keeping pace with the nets. Before that, nbid missed 10 games because of knee injury. Originally, he thought the 76ers would be thrown away by the nets. Unexpectedly, the 76ers survived! In the recent 11 games in which nbid was absent, the 76ers scored 7-4 and the winning rate exceeded 60%. It's a good thing and a bad thing. The good thing is that the 76ers still hold the initiative in ranking, waiting for the return of enbid. The bad side is that the 76ers can still hold the first place after being injured for such a long time. The chips of the MVP competition of the 76ers are less than one point, because the 76ers are the same with you and without you, because there are too many players that the 76ers can come forward at present!

First of all, let's talk about Denny green. This season, he averaged 9.8 points, 3.7 rebounds, 1.7 assists and 1.3 steals. His three-point shooting rate was 41.5%. This is a dream of the Raptors. You know, in the Lakers, Green's three-point shooting rate was only 36.7%, especially in the playoffs, which disappointed the fans! When he comes to the 76ers, under old rivers, the task of Denny green becomes lighter. He doesn't have to play in the No. 2 position. He only needs to restrict the opponent's small forward and participate in the cooperative defense. He has 5-7 three-point shots in each game, which is quite efficient! And the arrival of Denny green also completely liberated Harris, Harris also basically entered the 180 club this season (the free throw percentage was 89.5%, almost lost).

Howard also averaged 6.9 points + 8.3 rebounds this season, with a rebounding rate of 22.2%, third in the league, 30.7% in the backcourt, and second in the league! Howard's scoring depends on his own rebounds in the front court. In addition, his coverage on the defensive end and his blocking ability, including the efficiency of protecting the frame, greatly reduce the pressure on nbid. Howard presence, 76 rebounds higher, 76 second score more, and Howard's outstanding performance also let enbid can play efficiently and stably. And then there's Denny green. His ability to defend and attack, his ability to defend and attack, are all necessary for this 76 man. In some attack rounds, green and Simmons solve the problem without the participation of enbid.

Thanks to the help of the Lakers, nbid finally led this more powerful 76er to play the most perfect season of his career! This season, enbid averaged 29.9 points + 11.2 rebounds + 3.2 assists + 1.1 steals + 1.4 blocks, of which scoring + shooting percentage (52.1%) + three-point shooting percentage (39.4%) + steals all set a career high! However, the game contribution value of nbid is 20.7, which is the first place in the league!

It has to be said that nbid and the 76ers led by him have become the biggest enemies of harden and the nets. After getting the player of the Month award in the East for two consecutive months, harden said that he is the only MVP player of the season! If enbid keeps the current state and leads the 76ers to be the first in the East, then no matter from the public opinion, including the results, the league is likely to give the MVP to enbid instead of harden! The strength of the nets today, from the staffing of the interior, Durant's unsolvable strength, including Owen and harden in the back court, only 76 people in the East can barely be regarded as superior, because the 76 people's lineup does restrain the nets, Simmons is a strong defensive player in the back court, green and Harris are good offensive and defensive players in the front line, and enbid and Howard are sitting in the interior line Degaota, waiting to welcome the arrival of the nets! Nets and harden, before the finals left this one enemy!
