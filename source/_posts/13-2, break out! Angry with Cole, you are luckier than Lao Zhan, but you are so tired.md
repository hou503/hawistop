Maybe from the moment when the Rockets let harden go, they didn't expect that harden could change the regular season trend of the nets, the eastern pattern, and even the League Championship pattern. But as the assistant of the nets, d'antony may have thought of all this for a long time, which is why he insisted on adding the nets. At present, the basketball net is 29-14, ranking second in the East, one game behind the first 76, 0.5 games ahead of the third bucks. Yes, thanks to harden. In the case of Durant's long absence and Owen's stop and go, he led the net to turn over. The promotion of role players is harden's unique way of leading the team. In this case, Durant broke out.

The reason for this is that a reporter named syller tweeted: "cole told us that he preferred last season (15-50) to Kevin (Durant) in the warriors' last season." When the news of syller came out, Durant immediately replied: "this is ridiculous (funny) Cole explained at the press conference before the game against the 76ers: "I have to explain. Over the past few years, we are grateful. We have so many good memories. Kevin is always a part of us. He is very popular. We hope he goes well. If you really want to know what I said, just listen to what I said. They (journalists) just take it out of context! "

In fact, Cole was deliberately misunderstood by reporters, Cole's attitude is: it's easier to coach rookies than to compete for the championship season! From the head coach's point of view, that's right. And the sensitive and vulnerable Durant can't stand the slightest bit of negative news about him, especially when he was a warrior! American rapper Malone comforted Durant: "take it easy, big brother, you are Kevin. Life is so wonderful for you." Durant replied: "there is no so-called easy champion. I'm never easy on social platforms. I always turn off the software at 10 o'clock. You should take it easy." A kind-hearted netizen also left a message to Durant, saying that he didn't need to care about every reply, while Durant said: "this is a reply to you. You're welcome. End the day!"

You see, Durant's sensitivity and fragility are on the verge of collapse. In fact, Durant should be happy now. His two best brothers are Owen on the left and harden on the right. Last season, Durant spent the whole season. Owen said many times that Durant can help you to recover from the injury. You don't care about the rest. This season Durant Achilles tendon injury for a long time rest, harden said nothing, from the organization to the series to score, the nets in good order, and harden really made Owen comfortable to play. But just like this, there are also some good people who provoke Durant out. Yes, in the past, he took two finals MVPs on the shoulders of warriors. This season, he only needs to come back in the playoffs, because good brothers Owen and harden have paved the way for him.

Since Durant's absence on February 16, the nets have won 13-2 under the leadership of harden. During this period, Owen has missed three games and lost two games. One is harden's leading team to lose the lone ranger, and the other is shot by magic's unreasonable three-point ball. Finally, harden couldn't stand it. He was exhausted when he was fighting the Pacers. After that, there were two high-intensity battles, and his neck was injured. Owen has decided not to travel with the team because he deals with family affairs. How can he play against the next three opponents, the Blazers, the jazz and the pistons, two top six players in the western region and one bitter rebounder. Durant certainly wants to come back, but according to the advice of medical experts, Durant will have a hamstring injury review this week, and may continue to be absent for 1-2 weeks.

Durant is lucky, but also because he is too lucky, so much criticism, he is sensitive. Follow the warriors to win the championship, but also lead to Achilles tendon rupture. After coming to the nets, harden, Griffin and others rushed to the nets to build a super Galaxy warship against the Lakers and James, but Durant can no longer lead the team to win the championship like James. In contrast, after the warriors won two championships, Durant decided to leave the warriors and continue to compete for the championship because of the attitude of green and the warriors. He just wanted to prove that his historical status had nothing to do with the warriors!

In fact, James and Durant take two completely different paths because of their playing style. Although they need strong teammates on the way to win the championship, there are fewer matches for James because James needs a certain system. Durant is much simpler. Any system can play, with an average of 30 points per field. He has all kinds of advantages in singles, including the fact that death mode is often turned on at the last moment, and Durant is on the opposite side of old James. So, from the past to the present, Durant is more lucky than James, but in fact Durant is very tired, and Durant will always be James's biggest enemy.
