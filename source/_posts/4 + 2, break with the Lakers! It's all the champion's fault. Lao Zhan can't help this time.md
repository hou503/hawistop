Since Jen's injury, the Lakers have won 2-5 in the last seven games. They won one magic game and one Cavaliers game in the middle. The rest, including losing the eagles, Suns, pelicans, 76ers and bucks, seem to have little suspense. The management of the Lakers is too short of life-saving straws. On the deadline of the window trading period, they took the initiative to package pop and Schroeder to offer Lori, and signed Zhuang Shen to try to change all this. Zhuang Shen came to the first game of the Lakers, played 14 minutes, 2 in 6, got 4 points, 2 assists, 1 rebound, 1 block, 3 mistakes, 4 fouls, and injured. What bad luck!

The good news is that Zhuang Shen's right toe is bruised, X-ray examination is negative, and there is no structural damage. The bad news is that big Morris said in an interview that he once dropped a toenail, and was forced to rest for a month before he got better. In the words of Laker reporter Ryan, Zhuang Shen's situation is not optimistic. After the Lakers won the championship last season, Howard and McKee left the team. Why didn't the Lakers keep them! After all, it's useless to talk more. It's in the past, and people are not going to come back to help you. After the off-season introduction of Harrell and Pau Gasol, the problems of this season, to be honest, can't even help Jen!

When Adelaide bought out to join the nets, all the Laker fans fell into despair, and only one day later, Zhuang Shen announced to join the Laker, which made the originally gloomy Laker fans suddenly have light in their eyes! Yes, Zhuangshen didn't go to the net. Zhuangshen chose to join the Laker. He chose the Laker who could only give him $800000, which was enough to make all the Laker fans grateful! Zhuang Shen to the Lakers, the premise is at least to ensure the starting position, this is no problem, Zhuang Shen excitedly hope that the first show against magic will play. But everyone forgot little Gasol. When Zhuang Shen participated in the team training, from coach Vogel to teammates Kuzma, kaluso and Harrell praised Zhuang Shen's state, Gasol refused to speak twice in a row! When Zhuang Shen finished his debut, little Gasol only played for more than 5 minutes in the fourth quarter (originally fell out of rotation). After the game between little Gasol and bucks, he continued to refuse to be interviewed! Still in trouble with Zhuang Shen?

Little Gasol, that's right! When we are used to Howard's data of double rebounds last season, Gasol's data and performance are like Winton water, averaging 4.8 points + 3.9 rebounds + 1.9 assists, shooting 40.3%, not able to eat cake, extremely low efficiency of frame protection, low efficiency of hanging pick and roll, and likes squat pit defense. In short, his performance is always contrary to what the Lakers need! But don't forget that Gasol didn't plan to think about the Lakers first! After the expiration of Gasol's contract with raptors, raptors intend to keep Gasol. They can offer a contract similar to Baines's (US $14 million for two years), which is three times more than Gasol's earnings in the Lakers! Yes, there are lone Rangers. Kuban wants little Gasol to be a substitute for Poseidon, and he can also offer an average annual contract of 6-8 million yuan. But when the Lakers throw out an olive branch, little Gasol is not moved by the high salary, and resolutely joins the Lakers!

In order to get little Gasol, the Lakers were forced to send away McKee and split the contract of little Gasol (2 years, 5.2 million dollars, in fact, it is very likely to take only one year, and buy out the next year). In the eyes of the management of the Lakers, little Gasol is the perfect substitute for Howard. After all, in the past few years, he has been educating brother and emperor in the East, and little Gasol has really performed very stably and prominently There's a pass. When I signed people, I was like a dog. When I found out that it was not suitable, I felt ugly? Pau Gasol will regret choosing the Lakers. Isn't he here for a championship? He came to the Lakers with a pay cut. It's easy to say that his salary is less. Can't he get a pseudo starting position? The reality is that the Lakers don't want Gasol to play for a minute when they find that he can't play a fake starting role like McKee! Yeah, so why do reporters want little Gasol to speak so much? Would you like him to greet palinka and Zhuang Shen on Tomb Sweeping Day?

Zhuang Shen got four points and got injured in the game with bucks. As for whether he can catch up with the game in the future, it really depends on God's will. If it is really a long-term truce, he will have to help Gasol to the starting position. Little Gasol got 2 points in 5 minutes, but he showed with his actions that he only wanted to start, even if it was a fake start, it would be OK to play for 10 minutes! Zhuang Shen is the same. When he goes to the Los Angeles team for $800000, people don't pay attention to his salary. They just pay attention to the championship and the first round. Who do you choose? It's all the champion's fault! Off season also released Howard and McKee at the same time! Now the Lakers are using one mistake to make up for another, falling into a dead circle. When it comes to intrigue, I feel that there is still a long way to go for the team cohesion needed by the championship.
