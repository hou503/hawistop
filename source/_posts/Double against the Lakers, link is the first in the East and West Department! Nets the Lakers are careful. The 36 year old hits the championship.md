This season, the league is extremely fierce, the eastern three legs, the nets and the 76ers for the first, the Bucks firmly third, behind six teams for the fourth. The Western Conference clippers and the Los Angeles Lakers are third and fifth, with a sense of decline. On the contrary, the jazz is a new force, leading most of the season, and behind the jazz, only one team has not been left behind, not the clippers, not the Lakers, not the Nuggets, but the suns. It's a surprise. To be honest, Paul led the thunder to the fifth place in the western region last season, which has refreshed the cognition of many fans. How about giving Paul a playoff edge sun to take him to the second place in the western region?

You have to admit Paul's leadership. So far this season, Paul has averaged 31.8 minutes per game, more than in the thunder period. He averaged 16 points + 8.8 assists + 4.7 rebounds + 1.5 steals, among which the shooting percentage, three-point percentage, free throw percentage and assists were significantly improved, and Paul's real victory contribution value has reached the peak level of the Clippers period in the 14-15 season! The premise of Paul's dream back to the peak is that his average number of shots per game is only 12.3. He is 36 years old. Up to now, Paul's career total score is 19598 points + 10074 assists. He is 402 points away from becoming the first player with 20000 + 10000 assists in NBA history! It can be achieved as soon as the beginning of next season!

In a recent game against the Rockets, Paul played 35 minutes, 9 in 6, shot 19 points, 11 assists, 5 rebounds and 4 steals. He became the fifth player in NBA history who could give 10 + assists for 500 times, and the seventh player in NBA history who broke 2300 steals! In the previous game against the thunder, the Suns beat the opponent 140-103, Paul got 17 points, 5 rebounds, 12 assists, 3 steals and 8 shots. He was the oldest player in NBA history who got 15 + 5 + 5 and hit 100% in a single game! From March to now, the Suns record is 15-3, offensive efficiency League ninth, defensive efficiency League third, net efficiency League second, second only to 76!

In an interview with Steven a Smith, Paul talked about the reason why he chose Suns: "I know Booker's way of playing, his future is limitless, and Suns head coach Monty Williams, our team is very good, and there is a neglected player, Claude, who is just like Ariza around me, our team is very solid. I come here, I know what I want to do, I will continue to compete, strive to stand on the highest stage, I hope our team will not lose, this is certain Yes, under Paul's leadership, the Suns won 35 games in 49 games this season, more than the total number of games last season! And what they improve the most is their record when they play a strong team.

The Suns met the Lakers twice this season, beating them 111-94, 114-104. They also defeated the powerful 76ers at home 120-111, beat the Bucks 125-124 and the Jazz 106-95. They lost the first three games of the East and the West. Thanks to harden, the Suns led by 24 points at half-time. Harden completed the reversal and lost to the opponent 124-128. After the game, Javier and harden gave each other a hug. I believe harden will admire the 36 year old Javier for leading the team to the second place in the West. Paul will also wish harden a higher level in the net. 4-1, and the Suns are the only team in the league that wins more than 68% at home and away. In other words, this team is too stable!

Paul's improvement to this team is obvious. The average score of seven players is double, the attack and defense are in the top ten of the league, and the net efficiency is in the top three of the League! Although Booker was only selected as the all star by succession, and although the fans always ridicule Eaton's soft playing, most of their role players are not well-known except Claude, in the eyes of the nearly 36 year old cannon, the sun is very strong, much stronger than last year's thunder! So why not look forward to the finals or even the championship? Don't be surprised if the sun enters the western conference now. Don't be surprised even if he enters the finals. After all, Paul can always bring surprise to people! Sorry, curry's single core now leads the team to attack the playoffs are extravagant hopes, in Paul's here is not a problem, the nets and the Lakers should be careful, 36 year old cannon to lead this group of rough guys to attack the championship!
