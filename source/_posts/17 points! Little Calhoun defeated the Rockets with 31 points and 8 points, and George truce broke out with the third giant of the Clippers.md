The Clippers are a little scary. George, Ibaka, Beverly and Rondo were absent, and the team still scored double. Reggie gradually adapted to the role of the team's master. Although Reggie's performance fluctuated greatly, he was very confident. He scored 26 points in 14, 6 in 9, and won 29 points, the highest in the game! Reggie's match with Mann's back line has become a new trump card for tylenlu. Mann's impact and series ability make it easier for Leonard to switch seamlessly. According to the meaning of talen Lu, in the future, it is possible to let Cary and George stagger the rotation to prepare for the playoffs.
