The warriors win again. No curry, no Wiseman, no Pascal, Cole finally thought of Wiggins: this guy is now holding the team's second highest salary, dead horse as a live horse doctor. Hold a team meeting: listen, Andrew, you shot at least 20 times in this game. I don't care how many points you can get. Open your eyes and play a game seriously, will you? Wiggins: here! Playing 34 minutes 21 seconds, 24 shots hit 14 goals, 3-pointer 11 in 6, free throw 9 in 6, got 40 points, 8 rebounds, 4 assists and 4 steals, won a net of 24 points, the total number of shots, steals and 3-pointer are the highest data in the warriors in the past two years, leading the team to easily beat the Grizzlies 116-103.

In fact, for a long time before Wiggins, we have never seen such a player, scoring less than 20 points, but no one doubts that he is a parallel champion. For example, Mingming can be a Shaolin host, but he just wants to be a door sweeper. In the second quarter of the game with Grizzlies, there were 2 minutes and 50 seconds left. Green didn't hit the basket, and two big men, valanqiunas and Anderson, got stuck under the basket. Wiggins walked slowly from the free throw line, didn't run up, and bounced up directly. On the head of Valan, he flew the sledgehammer Anderson and smashed the ball into the basket with both hands! TNT commentator Kenneth joked: "no curry, no problem!" After Wiggins smashed the ball, walan was stunned. He couldn't think of anyone else in the league who could squeeze himself to one side and fly directly.

Wiggins himself said in an interview: "curry is our most important member, he is the driving force to lead the team forward, so when he is absent, I think we all have to redouble our efforts, I think I have to play aggressive from the beginning, I know I can (do it)." I have never doubted Wiggins's strength. If we only talk about his talent, he may be on top of curry and harden. He is 2.03 meters tall and 2.13 meters wide. When he first entered the league, he was hailed as the next LeBron. His physical condition is so good! Excellent bounce, lateral movement ability, amazing arm spread, at the beginning of the forest wolf, from Garnett to Butler, there is no praise for Wiggins, he is not parallel goods, just look down on the flowers.

A week ago, on Curry's 32nd birthday, the warriors beat the first jazz 131-119. Curry scored 32 points, and the winner of the warriors was Wiggins. In that game, Wiggins scored 12 of 16 and 3 of 4 with three-point goals, reaching a new high of 28 points in his single game this season. I believe that the fans will be impressed after watching that game. No matter Mitchell or O'Neill, or even gobel and Wiggins in the interior, they are not afraid. His physical condition is to crush an ordinary forward and defender. When he confronts a high center, his agility and explosive power are not at a loss. How many players in the league can he dunk on gobel's head? However, in the next two games, he scored 15 points against the Lakers and 17 points against the Rockets, and returned to his familiar identity of 16 Lang, averaging 16 points per game. In fact, he was also implicated by today's warrior system.

In Cole's system, only curry has unlimited right to fire, and only green has the right to dominate the ball. When green holds the ball, everyone, including curry, has to participate in a lot of running positions, pull the opponent's defense, wait for the opportunity to find space, and provide curry with shooting opportunities. Three years ago, this is the warrior's no solution to kill, because the two brothers can involve the attention of at least four opponents, including Livingston and Iguodala can cut empty, let alone a Durant. But now, really not. All opponents know to limit curry, green has no projection ability, Cole this set of high licensing system, everyone equalitarianism is out of date. Warriors this season is the worst team in the league with a victory rate of more than 50%, because opponents have 10000 ways to limit curry, and they limit the pick and roll of curry and green. Cole has no backhand.

In this case, Wiggins became a victim. Under normal circumstances, if Wiggins averaged 18-20 shots per game, there would be no problem for him to score 25 points per game. Apart from curry, who else can serve as the starting point of stable ball holding attack and also play the role of end point? At the present stage, the warriors' massive attack has turned into green holding the ball. He can't find a good chance for curry. He can either make a strong shot, or throw the pot to ubre or Wiggins in the last few seconds to make a strong shot. Of course, the effect is not good. Of course, it can't blame curry or Wiggins, who has never been a pitcher. It can only be said that Cole lacks flexibility and wastes a piece of jade. On the defensive side, Wiggins limited the opponent's hit rate and ranked first in the Warriors team!

Wiggins certainly can't kill God like Durant, but if he is given enough ball power, he can definitely become a star of Paul George's level, instead of the current 18 point player. His conscientious attitude and competitive style are really suitable to be Curry's helper. Cole needs to think about how to motivate Wiggins. The warriors are no longer galactic warships and don't need green to take the ball. But Cole should not continue to coach the warriors if he insists on a system of licensing and pick and roll. Wiggins is only 26 years old, in the golden period of his career. If he contributes 25 points per game, curry will wake up in his dreams. The warriors can also look forward to the impact of the top four in the western region!
