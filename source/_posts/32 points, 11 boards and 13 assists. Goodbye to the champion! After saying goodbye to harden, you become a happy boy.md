The wizard finally won the game, Xi Da Pu Ben! In a recent game, the wizard 131-122 defeated the first jazz in the league. Willis easily scored 35 points, 15 rebounds and 13 assists on Mitchell's head. Bill didn't let Willis' efforts in vain. He stepped forward in the second half and scored 43 points. It's not easy. After losing to Grizzlies, 76ers, bucks and kings, it seems that they have finally grasped the turning point. Maybe now there are not many people paying attention to Wei Shao. After Wei Shao came to the wizard, he played 33 games and got 13 triple doubles. When we watch him finish 2 + 1 on Mitchell's head, and then make the baby shake, we know that the familiar Westbrook is finally back!

This season, the wizard's record is very ups and downs. At the beginning of the season, they were 6-17, followed by 8-3. After that, they saw the dawn of the playoffs. But after that, there was another wave of five consecutive losses. This wave of five consecutive losses opened up a gap of 2.5 games between them and the tenth place Pacers, and a gap of 5 games between them and the sixth place Hornets. This season, the league has changed its game system to make it into the playoffs. The top six of the division will go straight into the playoffs, and 7-10 will play in the playoffs, which makes more teams participate. At the same time, the competition will become more brutal. What's his goal at this stage? Before the Jazz game, Williams said: "when the team is in trouble, I like to lead the team out of trouble. I am willing to accept the blame and take responsibility. This is my task, and I will not run away from any difficulties. " He did.

Since March, weishao has contributed 26.6 points + 7.7 rebounds + 11.9 assists per game, with a shooting rate of 48.3% and a three-point shooting rate of 42.1%. In the last four games, weishao has averaged 31.5 points + 11 rebounds + 13 assists per game. Weishao is the only player in the league who can average 30 + 10 + 10 per game in four games. After the Jazz game, jazz coach Snyder said: "this kind of game is too easy for Russell (weishao). We know him. He can easily break into the inside line and hit us. We play too casually." The Wizards have won 6-1 this season against teams with a 60% win rate in the Western Conference, including beating the Lakers, clippers, Suns and jazz in a row. He never bullies nobody here.

Weishao, who is 32 years old, actually lives like a child. A violent dunk can ignite his nerves, and a long time even defeat will make him sink into depression. In his mind, the team should not only win, but also play well, and show the team's cohesion and dominance. When he loses, he is always used to putting the responsibility on his shoulders, because it has been the case for more than 10 years. He has been the leader since the thunder. He has been used to taking all the doubts in the face of all kinds of accusations, holding the pressure and releasing himself on the court. This kind of character, this kind of attitude, the alliance is really rare now.

When harden told Williams that he decided to go to the net and join Durant, Williams submitted an application to leave the team. At that time, there were many onlookers, but few of them were really willing to trade weishao, including the Knicks and the Clippers. Only the wizard was willing to throw an olive branch. After all, there was his old mentor here. Wei Shao will clearly and rationally recognize one point: at this age, with a salary of more than 40 million, it's really difficult for him to compete for the championship. He has not been the top ten superstar in the League for a long time. With the decline of his physical condition, he may not be able to become the core of the stable play required by the championship team, so what can he do? In addition to the championship, weishao has almost all of them. He is the scoring champion, the assists champion, the All-Star MVP, the best lineup, the world championship champion, the Olympic champion and three doubles per game in three seasons. He has long been recorded in history.

So Willis is duty bound to report to the wizard that he knows this team can't compete for the championship, but he can still control the ball at his age. He often shoots three doubles and leads the team to fight against the nets, clippers, the Lakers and other teams. That's enough. After he left the thunder, he can still be the hard bone in the eyes of the so-called champions, no matter in the side of harden or bill, which has proved the success of weishao. Of course, after winning, Wei Shao will show a messy dance on the sidelines, have a passionate hug with bill, and constantly roar at the camera. Wei Shao is the same Wei Shao.

This league, with 30 teams and more than 400 players, is very difficult to compete for the final championship. But for Wei Shao, it's not to win the championship that he can be regarded as a complete success. He's happy now, too. At present, the total number of weishao's triple doubles is 159, 22 times less than the first place Robertson. Next season, weishao will become the triple doubles champion in NBA history. Maybe he will hit 200 milestones, maybe he will also become the triple doubles champion of the Wizards. Besides the championship, he still has many things to pursue. Playing with harden, he worked hard to bring victory to the team. After leaving harden, he became a happy teenager again. The sky is blue and Westbrook is all over the window. Come on, tortoise!
