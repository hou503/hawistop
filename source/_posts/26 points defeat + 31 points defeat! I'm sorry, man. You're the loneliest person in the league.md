In the first game after the all star weekend, the warriors lost the Clippers 104-130. Under the restriction of George and Reggie, curry scored 6 in 16 and only scored 14 points in that game. Then the warriors broke out all over the country and won the first jazz in the league, which was regarded as the celebration of Curry's 33rd birthday. But in a recent game, the warriors lost the Lakers 97-128, thanks to Vogel's mercy, early let the Lakers punch out a few points, otherwise the warriors may lose 40 points. After the match, curry was very desperate: "yesterday we played that kind of performance, we had high expectations of ourselves, today we suffered a disastrous defeat, that's why we have such a record. It takes a lot to win, it's not easy

Curry is really desperate, because the warriors have no fighting power against the real kings of the Western Conference, the Lakers and the Clippers. But Cole's words after the game were puzzling: "in the past 36 hours, we've beaten the best team in the League through defense, and then lost 31 points. What kind of team are we? Where is our strength? " You are the head coach, do you want to get the answer from the reporters? Warriors this season's salary is 173 million dollars, excluding clay who can't play the game, 35 million dollars, and 138 million dollars. Curry has 43 million dollars, and the rest is close to 100 million dollars. What's wrong? To tell you the truth, the Knicks, the league's lowest paid team, earn less than $90 million. Their record is 20-20, just like the warriors.

First of all, let's talk about this warrior's nominally second in command, Wiggins. This season, Wiggins averaged 17.2 points + 4.5 rebounds + 2.1 assists + 1 block, with a shooting percentage of 47.1% and a three-point shooting percentage of 36.5%, similar to the rookie season. But to tell you the truth, Wiggins' performance this season has not attracted much criticism. In terms of limiting the opponent's shooting percentage, he is the best in the warriors. He often plays the tandem offensive player in the three or four quarters. Don't give Wiggins too much pressure. In the last game against Jazz, Wiggins scored 28 points in 12 of 16, with super high efficiency, but he only played nine times against the Lakers Hands. In the game with the Lakers, he was nearly 20 points behind in the third quarter. When I think of it, Wiggins played solo. Wiggins scored 10 points in 4 of 5 in a short time. The Lakers called a time-out. After two rounds, Cole took the initiative to replace Wiggins. It's not about Wiggins, it's about the distribution of the ball rights of the warriors!

At that time, the warriors had two choices. The water brothers were waiting for the opportunity to pull the opponent's defense and look for empty opportunities. Even if the tactics were not successful, they would give the ball to Durant and let Durant end up. Anyway, he would be able to score. But the premise of this kind of play is the super projection ability of Shuihua brothers and Durant's ability of no solution singles. Green only needs to give the ball to the most suitable player. This season, this is also Cole's main tactics. Green deals cards at the top of the arc, and there is no opponent restriction within 5 meters. Everyone knows that green can't score. This is a little bad for the Warriors: it compresses other people's activity space, causing curry, ubre and Wiggins to be forced to shuttle back and forth in two corners. But ubre and Wiggins are not the kind of fixed-point pitchers, curry is also targeted, so this kind of tactical effect is really not good.

Second, Green's defensive role is declining. Warriors is the worst team in the league with a winning rate of more than 50% (including 50%). If you are strong, it's because the way for the warriors to win is for curry to play stably and efficiently. At the same time, we hope that Wiggins, ubre, or beizmore and Werner MEK on the bench can play well. Only in this way can we win. The warriors are too short of frame protection. Rooney's frame protection efficiency is very general. Wiseman obviously doesn't want to do dirty work. In the small lineup system, green only relies on small moves to limit the opponent's high center, which has long been out of date. Even Harrell, who is only over 2 meters tall, can break the inside line of the warriors, and Ibaka can crush green directly, so what can the warriors take to compete with the strong teams?

Back to the topic of Wiggins, when Wiggins felt hot, green dealt cards. For the first time, he only looked for curry. In the equalitarian Warriors team, only curry had unlimited firing power. So it's no wonder why Wiggins didn't get high scores, because Wiggins rarely had the space and right to hold the ball to attack the basket. Of course, Cole is still trying to play Green's pick and roll for curry and Wiggins this season. Including ubre, they all enjoy the treatment of Green's pick and roll, but the effect is even worse. Pick and roll is to send clips to teammates. Because green doesn't shoot, he is not tall enough in the penalty area, and his passing purpose is too strong, so the warriors are struggling now, and green is the biggest short board now.

Sorry, curry, you're the loneliest person in the league. Previously, the US media listed a set of data. In NBA history, a total of 8 people have won multiple MVPs and more than 3 Championships. The threshold is very high, enough to go down in history! There are only two people on active duty: James and curry. Curry got two MVPs and three championships, James got four MVPs and four championships. But the Lakers, led by James, are still on the road. Even if Davis is absent for a long time, there are more players in the team. What about curry? In the past few years, the warriors dominated the league. When they gave green and clay a big contract, they found that the era was over. Green's retrogression was a fact. What about clay's future? What about curry? When Durant left, curry supported Golden State alone. He was too lonely.
