After getting harden, the net has made great progress this season. In the case of Durant's long absence and Owen's stop and go, harden leads the team to bite 76 people all the way, ranking second in the East all the time, which is awe inspiring! In a recent game, the nets 113-111 beat the pistons, harden 42 minutes, 30 in 14, a total of 44 points, 14 rebounds, 8 assists, fight to six offense to leave, lead the team to win the pistons this strong team killer, it is not easy! After the game, a reporter asked harden: "you are ranked sixth in the MVP list. What do you think of this?" Harden said simply: "I feel like I'm MVP. It's so simple!"

This season, harden played a total of 31 games for the nets, averaging 38.6 minutes, ranking first in the league, averaging 26 points + 8.9 rebounds + 11.4 assists + 1.4 steals, in addition to scoring, the remaining three data are ranked first in the team! In addition to the game against the pistons, harden has got 40 + 10 + 5 data for 29 times in his career, which is the first person since the three-point era of NBA was established in the last 40 years! This is also the 31st time in his career that harden has scored 40 points and 10 rebounds. In NBA history, only Robertson (32 times) is more than him. This is also the 300th regular season single game of harden at least 30 +, 8 times less than the 14th place Durant in history, and harden entered the NBA two years later than Durant!

Statistics show that since harden joined the nets, the nets at the critical moment (the last 5 minutes, the difference is less than 5 points) record is 17-3, while before harden joined, the nets at the critical moment record is only 3-4! The 31 games led by harden, the net record is 23-8, second only to the Jazz in the same period! In the words of Paul Pierce: "so far, in the MVP rankings, the first place is harden, and the second and subsequent rankings are arbitrary." Barkley also expressed the same view: "now it's not that I don't respect LeBron or Janice, just look at the performance of the team leader, no one can compare with harden, he is always habitually ignored!"

When harden got the best player in the East in February, he ranked 10th in MVP in the first half and eighth in MVP in the second half. In the last two issues, although harden has led the remnant basketball net to keep the second place in the East, in the MVP list, he is still inferior to the half month truce of enbid, just ranked sixth! The No. 1 player, joachi, averaged 27 points, 11.3 rebounds and 8.5 assists per game, ranked first for two consecutive periods, and led the Nuggets only ranked fifth in the West! The second ranked letter brother, averaged 28.6 points + 11.6 rebounds + 6.4 assists + 1.3 blocks, led the Bucks ranked third in the East, but the letter brother from the ninth to the sixth to the third and then to the second in the last four periods, leaping up like a rocket! So where on earth is harden inferior to them?

In fact, there is no doubt about harden's ability, which has been recognized by numerous famous players and experts. His projection ability, dribbling breakthrough ability, foul making ability, including the ability of counterpoint defense and series organization, are all at the top level of the league. In Buckley's words, if any team lacks Owen and Durant, who can imagine that it can still occupy the second place in the east? Harden can really lead the team to do all this, but what harden did in the first half of this season in the Rockets has also made the League bear a grudge: at the beginning, harden insisted on leaving the team, including going to nightclubs and throwing money on friends' birthday, which caused other teams to report to the League for punishment. Harden brought bad demonstration to the core of other teams. At that time, the alliance changed from big to small, but it didn't mean that it was over.

So when harden is getting better in the net, when he thinks he should be MVP, he is deliberately ignored by the League! If Jokic and nbid have played an efficient season, and if Jen is not injured, they can also play MVP. We can understand these three people. After all, they have performed very well this season. It is incomprehensible for them to rise to the second place all the way. No projection ability, Bucks reverse competition ability League bottom, letter brother key moment efficiency is very low, but because bucks in the true sense of the giant only letter brother, so he became a lucky and big winner! With the deepening of the season, joachic and Lillard lead the team to the disadvantage of the results, the injury of old Zhan and enbid, they will slowly withdraw from the fight, naturally, the letter brother has a great chance to get MVP San Lian Zhuang!

Don't deceive yourself, harden. You are not the opponent of the league and brother alphabet. Brother alphabet may be worthy of MVP, but MVP is not worthy of you!
