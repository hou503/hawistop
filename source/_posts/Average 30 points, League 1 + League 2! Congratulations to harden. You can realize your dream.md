One fence, three stakes, one hero, three gangs. When harden, Griffin, Durant and little Jordan were chatting with each other and playing mixed games off the court, Owen and Adelaide beat the fourth big black horse Hornets in the East with 22 points. Interestingly, Owen did not score the highest in the nets, but Jeff Green's 21 points. What's more interesting is that Owen only scored 15 points in 17 shots, while six in the nets scored double. Is that Owen's lead style? Is this still the giant net? Think of Xingye in the "God of food" in the classic lines: there is no giant in the world, or everyone is a giant. Congratulations to harden, welcome the best partner, and for Owen, this season means a lot.

After beating the Hornets, Owen said: "harmony within the team is the cornerstone of victory. We want conflicts to stay away from our dressing room. We just want to achieve each other." Before talking about Durant's comeback, Owen said frankly: "everyone of us miss him very much. We can't wait to see him come back. The whole team respects his position as a leader. This is the respect that comes with strength. We all know this." You see, who said Owen was a cancer of the dressing room? Who said Owen was the cold king? Every time Adelaide scored a goal, the most exaggerated celebration was Owen, dancing off the court. Harden led the team to win. Owen threw himself into his arms every time. Now Durant will return, and Owen is sending sweet words. Owen is obviously the social flower of the nets, the leader of the atmosphere group!

There is no doubt that Owen's offensive talent is absolutely at the top level of the league. He must be in the top five or even the top three. In the past March, Owen, who scored 30.2 points per game, ranked first in the league! And this season since the start of updating the player offensive efficiency list, Owen has been more than 120, playing now 120.9, ranking second in the league, second only to Leonard in the League! what do you mean? When harden leads the team to fight in the positional war with warm water, Owen is like the catfish with the most comprehensive skills and the strongest ability in the rebounding team. The counterattack is as fast as lightning, and there is no solution in positional singles. Harden and Owen just formed the eight trigrams array, with Yin on one side and Yang on the other, promoting each other.

It has to be said that Owen is the best partner for harden to enter the league and grow into a super giant! No one. From the beginning of Howard's time, he fought with harden for power. Later, Paul was a great enough point guard to control the ball, but he couldn't share the pressure on harden. In addition, there was a conflict between the two in the second year. One slap didn't make a sound. There must be something wrong with both of them. Then to the back of weishao, when weishao came to harden's side, the rhythm of his field control was not as good as Paul, he did not have the ability to shoot without the ball, harden's pressure was greater! Including the Rockets has been shrinking spending, so he can not see any hope, in the 8 years of the Rockets, harden can not wait for the super giant partner in the golden period of his career, so after being eliminated by the Lakers, he said: "we only lack a key man now!"

Since February 11, the nets have won 20 of their last 23 games, the first time in the history of the team! And lost three games, playing jazz Owen harden is not in, playing Lone Ranger Owen is not in, playing magic, it is pure by the opponent three-point ball to throw confused! Meanwhile, harden also set a record in a row: he scored six triple doubles in a single month, creating a personal triple double record in the history of the nets; he won 11-2 in a single month in March, drawing the best record in the history of the team in a single month; harden became the first player in the history of the NBA who won the best honor of the month for two consecutive months after joining a new team, and the third player in the history of the nets who won the best of the month for many times. Why can harden take over everything in front of Owen, who is famous for his selfishness? At the end of the day, it's mutual perfection!

As soon as harden arrived, the team was willing to make sacrifices, sacrifice their scoring data, drive role players to play, and let Owen play the role of the only scoring point. Owen's efficiency is really high, but he is also learning from harden's leading mode, because the net is really improved under harden's leadership. So when harden is on the scene, Owen is the first scoring point. When harden is not on the scene, Owen also feeds his teammates cake in a typical way and learns to change his rhythm and playing style to make his teammates better. That's enough, that's enough for harden and Owen to lead the team to number one in the East! Harden found a career match, and for Owen, the original purpose of his joint efforts with Durant was to beat the Lakers and James, now, the dream is becoming a reality step by step.
