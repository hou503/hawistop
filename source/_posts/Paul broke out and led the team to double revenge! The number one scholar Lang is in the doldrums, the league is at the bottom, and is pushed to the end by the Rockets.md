The Suns are really hard today. In the middle of the second quarter of the game, Suns coach Monty Williams was expelled because he complained that the referee had two consecutive technical offenses. Paul only wanted to create scoring opportunities for bridges, Booker and nedell in the whole first half. The Suns didn't take too much initiative, even if they successfully limited Edwards on the defensive end. In the third quarter, Paul led the team alone to wipe out the equaliser is particularly critical. Paul's offensive efficiency with the ball is relatively high, but this is not the way he likes. The Suns need to adjust their hand as soon as possible.

The Rockets suffered 19 consecutive losses. Before this game, the Rockets had a record of 11-29, and only Timberwolves had a worse record than the Rockets in the whole league. And the Rockets are only 1.5 games ahead of the Timberwolves. If the Rockets lose like this, they won't have to wait until the end of the month, and the Rockets will fall to the bottom of the league. Timberwolves have lost 7 of their last 10 games, which has been overtaken by the Rockets. The last three in the league this season have basically locked in the Rockets, Timberwolves and pistons. Let's see who can win the number one draw, but it may not be useful to get the number one draw, such as Timberwolves this season.
