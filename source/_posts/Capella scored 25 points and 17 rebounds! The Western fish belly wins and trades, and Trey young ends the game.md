Capella is the eagles' best player. 31 minutes, 10 in 12, a total of 25 points, 17 rebounds, 2 assists, 1 steals, 1 blocks, including 9 front court rebounds, the highest positive and negative value of the team is + 8! In fact, most of Capella's scores come from his second rebounding. He doesn't really get many assists from his teammates. Trey young likes to make fouls with the ball, Collins plays singles with the ball, schulter is a fixed-point shooter, and Snell doesn't have much sense of existence. It's really not easy for Capella to get this kind of data under this system. There is a suspicion of being buried! But there is no doubt that Capella is now the league's top center. And Trey young has now formed a very bad habit, even if the sky basket, waiting for the opponent to foul, trying to win the free throw, which is a little difficult to understand.

Now the competition in the west is very complicated. In fact, the 13th king is also likely to compete in the playoffs. They are only 3.5 games behind the 10th Grizzlies. Their talent is useless. Fox, Halliburton, Bagley and others are plastic talents, but Wharton does not unite them as a whole. Of course, the king is also broken, they are not willing to fire Wharton, do not want to pay high liquidated damages, so just muddle along. There are only two teams in the west, the rockets and the Timberwolves, whose goal is this summer's draft. And after this game, the king and the pistons completed the transaction, the king sent Joseph and two second round signings, from the pistons in exchange for dranlette, it seems that the king also wants to fight a playoff!
