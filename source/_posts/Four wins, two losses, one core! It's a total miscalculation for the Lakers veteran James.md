The Clippers lost again! No one would have thought that in the middle of the season, the Clippers couldn't even get into the top three in the West. Compared with the same period last year, the 25-15 record has also declined. It is reasonable to say that the Clippers should not have been like this. In the latest game, the clippers were defeated by pelicans 115-135, more than 30 points behind in three quarters. After the game, Kaka was very dissatisfied: "if we want to get a chance in anything, we have to be stable, everyone has to work hard, I am very worried (team stability)" "We've been missing people all year and the outside world won't expect us to lose, but if we continue to play like this, we'll lose 50 points to the lone ranger tomorrow," he said In the words of the reporter with the clipper team, taranlu broke the dirty words at the press conference.

Coincidentally, the clippers have lost 50 points to the lone ranger this season. On December 28 last year, Leonard was injured and absent, and the clippers were nailed to the historical stigma when they lost the lone ranger 73-124 at home! What happened to the Clippers recently? In the last five games, I lost bucks, Celtics, wizards, warriors and pelicans. Among them, the first three losses were the collapse at the critical moment. When it came to the decisive moment, no one came forward to score, including Leonard and Paul George. In the game of beating the warriors, he scored 45 points in the third quarter to beat the warriors. However, when he met pelican, he was beaten by his opponent. As one of the most popular champions in these two years, this kind of performance is far from the championship.

Clippers this season's three-point shooting rate is still the first in the league, the team's three-point shooting rate has reached a terrible 42%, but their critical moment (the last five minutes with a difference of less than 5 points) hit rate, scoring, assists, limit opponents hit rate, net efficiency value are all the bottom five in the league, it is reasonable to have Leonard this key player, they should not pull so at the critical moment In the last six games, George averaged 17.8 points + 4.6 rebounds + 5 assists, with a three-point shooting rate of 27.8%. Since the thunder period and after the All-Star weekend, George has completely lost sight, which is the case every year.

Last season, old rivers insisted on the combination of Rowe and Harrell. Although he caused a lot of complaints in the team and attracted a lot of criticism from the media, at least Leonard and George got enough rest time. Only by the playoffs, the infighting could not be covered up and the wall collapsed. This season, Taylor Lu insists on playing as a superstar, and Luwei is in a semi refrigerated state. Unless there is really no one available, Luwei will be on Luwei. Otherwise, Luwei's position is behind Reggie, Kennard and even young man. If the Clippers are short of Dewey and Harrell, the most intuitive performance is that they are short of firepower output with an average of nearly 40 points per game. Do you expect Leonard and George to make up for it? It's impossible. Leonard's average score per game is less than last season. Paul George is in his early 20s and has returned to mediocrity. Now there is no dispute in the team. It looks very harmonious, but the beam of the house is cracked.

Statistics show that in the past three seasons, when Beverly played, the Clippers' record was 105-53, while when Beverly was absent, their record was only 17-19. Beverly is a distinct representative of the clippers, Beverly is the main defense opponent's small guard, although his action is not clean, character is also more extreme, but his defensive effect is very good, to put it bluntly is to die with the opponent's victim. And in this clippers lineup, they are all ready to die with the Lakers. In the past two seasons, James averaged less than 22 points when he met the clippers, but when the Lakers beat the Blazers and rockets in the playoffs, where are the Clippers?

In the off-season, the clippers and Maurice completed a four-year $64 million contract extension, including winning Ibaka, signing jatam, and constantly expanding their forward strength. Their forward line is indeed the top level of the league. It is no exaggeration to say that if the Lakers really fight with the Clippers in seven games, the roulette can consume Jen and Davis enough, and the teams of the clippers, George, Maurice, Ibaka and bartum are the best It's all for the Lakers, for James, because at the beginning, Carlos joined the Clippers just to bring down James' Lakers. If the Western Conference competes with these two teams, from a rational point of view, the clippers have a great chance of beating the Lakers. But the two short boards of the clipper are also exposed!

Without the inside, how to fight against Nuggets' Jokic, jazz's Gerber, lone ranger's Poseidon, the suns and a blue collar's Aton, the Clippers rely on the old Ibaka and the young zubaz? The Clippers' three-point goal is really accurate, but when the overall intensity of the playoffs increases, when the opponent begins to take man to man measures to limit the role players to play more, can Carr and George play alone? How can there be so much space for singles! They don't have a core organization. Are the two small forwards really safe in the playoffs? They don't know what to do at this critical moment, what to do in the playoffs? From the year before last, I laid a net for the Lakers. Now, it's still full of holes. I'm afraid you'll sink before the Lakers.
