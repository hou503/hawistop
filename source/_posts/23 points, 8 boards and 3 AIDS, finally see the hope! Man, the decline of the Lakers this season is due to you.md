The Lakers are having a hard time. Since Jen was injured, the team has been 2-5 in the last seven games, beating the magic and Cavaliers. However, they have no resistance against the 76ers, bucks, Suns and even pelicans. In fact, this has been able to roughly determine the real level of the Lakers in the league, who lack the thick eyebrows and Davis: better than the Cavaliers and magic, almost the same level as the Bulls thunder, about 22 in the League! Up to now, the Lakers are 30-18, 0.5 games ahead of nuggets and blazers. One thing is for sure, the top four can't be kept. Can the top six be kept?

After the deadline of the trading window, Hayes talked about the current situation of the Lakers in a podcast. Yes, it's a pity for the Lakers to miss Lori, but it's hard to make a change. Lori wants to go to the heat, but the heat can't get a chip. The package price of Schroeder + pop doesn't seem to be too attractive. In that program, Hayes revealed that according to the information he got, Anthony Davis is about 20 days away from his comeback. One thing is for sure, James must come back behind Davis. Of course, the worst situation for James is that he has been on the sidelines all April. After the trade deadline, the Lakers have played three games, the latest one lost to the bucks. When Davis comes back, what will the Lakers fall to in the west?

If Davis returns in mid April, the Lakers will have to play eight games without Jamie, including kings, clippers, raptors, heat, nets, Knicks, Hornets and green. The first seven games are all road trips. Now Zhuang Shen is injured. The only thing the Lakers can rely on is Harrell, Kuzma, Schroeder and Maurice. But at least Davis finally let the Lakers fans see the hope, he did not return to time before the truce way, too hurt! Davis only played 23 games this season, averaging 22.5 points + 8.4 rebounds + 3 assists + 1.3 steals + 1.8 blocks. Compared with last season, Davis's playing time is decreasing, and the number of shots is decreasing, including rebounds and blocks. Only the shooting percentage has some improvement, but there is still Achilles tendon injury. Here we need to explain Davis's glass attributes.

Davis pulled his right calf in the Nuggets Game on February 15 and then withdrew from the game. On the 19th, the doctor of the Lakers made a comprehensive evaluation of Davis and concluded that he was expected to be absent for four weeks! This four weeks is based on Davis injury estimate + recovery time + recovery training time to give a comprehensive consideration. By the end of February, ESPN reporters and Davis agent Ricky Paul got the latest progress in communication: Davis Achilles tendon is no problem, according to the common sense, he will be able to return in March, but the Lakers and Davis will be patient, Davis said frankly: I hope to return in a completely healthy situation! This is contrary to the expectation of the doctor of the Los Angeles team, and the truce is one and a half months! And it will take another two weeks to get back on the pitch.

To tell you the truth, the Lakers have had such twists and turns this season, which has the most direct relationship with Davis. Although when Davis was out of action, Jen led the team to hold the second place in the west, the result of his record is that Jen was also injured! Of course, Davis can't be blamed. Of course, Davis wants to play. But with Durant's lessons, no one will make fun of his career. Especially after the Lakers have just won a championship, the golden period of James' career is just two or three years. For Davis and James, this is the last chance. That's a bad time for Davis! The off-season period is too short. The inside line of the Lakers lacks the protection of the boxers. Davis has been fighting against the high center for a long time. In Davis's own words, his right calf was injured originally. The collision with Jokic aggravated the injury. Whose fault is it?

So don't blame Davis. Although the current defensive efficiency of the Lakers is still at the top level of the league, it is inseparable from the defense pressure shared by Jen, Kuzma and Davis. In fact, the defense ability shown by little Gasol before, including the help to Davis, is not big! Of course, the Lakers know that, so they are eager to get Zhuang Shen. But Zhuang Shen is injured after only one game, or his toenails fall off. This may be a disease that needs recuperation. The Lakers are really more and more difficult! It seems that the decline of the Lakers this season is caused by Davis. In fact, the management of the Lakers has moved the team framework themselves. It doesn't matter to move the framework, but it's useless to ensure that James and Davis can get enough help in the regular season.

The last question, Davis is here, can the Lakers get out of the mud? I think it's hard. I have to wait for Lao Zhan! I hope the Lakers don't fall behind eighth place, or they will be very passive.
