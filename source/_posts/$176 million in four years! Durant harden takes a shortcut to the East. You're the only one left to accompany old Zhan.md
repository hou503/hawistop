According to the global rich list released by Forbes, clippers boss Ballmer's total assets have increased by 30% in the past year (from $52.8 billion to $68.7 billion). He still ranks first in the NBA rich list, while rebounds boss Tsai Chongxin's assets are $11.6 billion. The situation in the western region is very chaotic this season. The jazz and the Suns have sprung up, leaving the clippers, nuggets and the Los Angeles Lakers far behind. The Los Angeles Lakers have not achieved ideal results due to the injury of Jamie. But to be honest, the only team that can pose a threat to the Los Angeles Lakers in the western region is probably the Clippers whose strength is infinitely close to and matched with each other.

The data shows that when George and Leonard are present at the same time, the Clippers' record is 25-9, with a winning rate of 73.5%, second only to 20-5 of harden Owen! According to Hollinger of the Olympic, as long as there is no dramatic change, it is generally believed that Leonard will reach a contract extension with the Clippers in the off-season. This season, Leonard played 43 games for the clippers, averaging 25.8 points, 6.7 rebounds and 5 assists, with a three-point shooting rate of 39%. According to the labor agreement, xiaoka signed a four-year $176 million top salary contract with the Clippers at most, with a starting salary of $39.3 million (35% of the salary cap). Because xiaoka signed a 2 + 1 contract before, the Clippers had no bird rights, so they could not complete a five-year super top salary contract with him. In other words, the Clippers could provide all the contracts that the Clippers could come up with.

But where can Leonard go? At the beginning, after the Raptors won the championship, the Raptors made every effort to retain Leonard, to deliver the house, to send the penthouse, to send the big contract in advance. Even the mayor of Toronto said that as long as Leonard was willing to stay, he could even take his place as mayor. But Leonard is homesick and eager to return to Los Angeles. But the Lakers already have James and Davis, and Leonard is not willing to join the Lakers as the third giant, even if the Lakers released $32 million in salary space in the summer of 19. Maybe the Raptors win the championship to give him self-confidence, he takes pickled peppers in the clippers, and in the future, he can only stay in Los Angeles, stay in the Clippers.

The competition in the league is really fierce this season. Of course, it's true that the strong teams are stronger, but the polarization is too serious. Dunant, Owen and harden are the three major players in the net, and Adelaide and Griffin are recruited to make up for the lack of inside line. This net has no short board! Including the Bucks, the team has also been recruiting for the letter brother, in exchange for huoledi, signing Portis, Forbes and other valiant, trading to tucker to increase the thickness of the front line. Including 76 people also add help for nbid, small curry, green, Howard's arrival to enhance the overall strength of the team. The top three teams in the East continue to attract talents from the West. The way the heat reached the finals last season gave all teams a shortcut. It turned out that they only needed to meet James in the finals.

Many giants in the league have been traveling eastward, starting with the joint efforts of Durant and Owen. Indeed, in the East, where the competition is not so fierce, there is no need to meet the Lakers and James before the finals. This is already a shortcut, and Leonard will probably continue to compete with James. The clippers have a new look this season. After sending off the so-called "cancer" of Harrell and Dewey, we got Kennard, bartum, Ibaka, Rondo in the trading window period, and also signed koshins. First of all, the Clippers finally had a decent point guard, and had great experience in the playoffs to control the overall situation. Rondo was the best choice. He was also an important meritorious player for the Lakers to win the championship last season.

In addition, talen Lu has given Carlos and George a lot of freedom here, and neither of them is a dominant player. They have fully mobilized their teammates. Since March, they have often staged 20 + scenes, including young Morris, Kennard, Mann and Reggie. They have come forward to lead the team to win. Even though they are always short of major generals, the Clippers players play like the core players of the team Are they going to capsize before they meet the Lakers this season? In other words, it's really hard for Jen and the Lakers this year. The big three of the eastern basketball net lead the team and are invincible. Clippers this season also did not have domestic and foreign troubles, gradually into a better situation. If Jen can defend the title successfully, it will go down in history, and there will be little time left for Jen and the Lakers. No matter who laughs to the end, he is a gold medal winner.
