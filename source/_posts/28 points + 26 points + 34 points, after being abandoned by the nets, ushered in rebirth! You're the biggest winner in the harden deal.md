James led the Lakers to win the championship last season. In the off-season, more teams focus on strengthening the team and strive to fight against the Lakers led by James. And this season's biggest winner is the rising super Galaxy battleship. Owen and Durant's cooperation let them see the hope of rushing out of the East, and the arrival of harden is the turning point of the team. Harden has changed the team, linked the team's attack, led the team to pass alone, in Durant's long-term truce, Owen's stop and go situation, the nets also won the first place in the East! What did the nets pay to get harden? Allen + Prince + lewell + kurutz + 3 first round picks + 4 first round picks. Since then, the Rockets traded separately, with Allen + prince from the Cavaliers in exchange for bucks first round signing + axam, with lewell from the Pacers in exchange for oradipo.

To tell you the truth, the basketball net's chips are not high, and the Rockets can be regarded as giving harden a favor. Before Lowell went to the Rockets to report, he was told that he had been sent to Indiana. Because the Rockets didn't like him, the Rockets directly traded him for oradipo! Lewell was very unfortunate. The day before, he was still thinking about how to win the championship with Owen and Durant. The next day, he was told to change two teams and report to Indiana. But lewell was also very lucky. When the Indiana team doctor examined him, he found a lump in his left kidney, but the walkers didn't return it because they were eager to send oradipo away. Soon, lewell was arranged to have an operation on left renal cell carcinoma. The operation was very successful. He finished the operation on January 27 and had a rest of less than two months. On March 14, he formally went out on behalf of the walkers.

Let's talk about the rocket that abandoned Lowell. After the Rockets traded lewell for oradibo, they tried to offer him a price of 45.2 million US dollars in two years. Oradibo directly refused and made a statement through his agent that he would go to the heat if he was not in the Rockets in the future. Oradibo has played 20 games on behalf of the Rockets, averaging 21.2 points + 4.8 rebounds + 5 assists. It seems that the data is pretty good, reaching the level of 20 + 5 + 5. However, oradibo's average shot number has reached 19 times, which is more than that of wall, wood, harden (not traded to the net), Gordon and others. What's the level? Oradibo's effective hit rate is beyond 280 in the league, which is lower than Wall! In the end, the Rockets compromised. They knew that they had to turn things around, but they still satisfied oradipo and sent him to the heat ahead of time in exchange for Bradley and ollico, who had refused to represent the Lakers in the second round.

In other words, the Rockets in the deal, harden only won four first round signings, or nets and bucks first round signings, and then sent out oladibo, in exchange for the heat in 2022 first round signing swap rights. All that's left are Bradley and orinico's two expiring contracts. If the Rockets really want to go bad, why not keep Allen and lewell? Instead, to cultivate the second round show little Potter? When oradibo was sent to the heat, rockets reporter Ike said frankly that the Rockets had taken a fancy to oradibo's reputation at the beginning, but using lewell to exchange oradibo became a mistake of rocket management. Lewell, who didn't join the Rockets, was lucky because he was finally reborn in the Pacers!

When he came to the Pacers, two months after the surgery, lewell played as a substitute and soon conquered the team and his teammates. Sabonis said that lewell was the abandoned pearl, and Broughton said that lewell was one of the best partners he had ever met. In recent games, against the pistons, lewell scored 28 points in 10 of 19, leading the team to win; against the Spurs, lewell scored 26 points in 10 of 19, leading the team to win the spurs; against the Grizzlies, lewell scored 34 points in 14 of 20, leading the team to defeat the Grizzlies. In the words of Pacers coach Nate yorklan, the biggest gain of this season is to get lewell. There is no better choice for this team than him. Indiana reporter revealed that Pacers are confident to build a team around sabonis and lewell in the future. Lewell is considered to be one of the core of the team in the future!

Lewell is unfortunate, because he played well in the net, he was suddenly abandoned by the team. But lewell is also the luckiest, because this transaction, he only learned that his kidney cells are cancerous in the physical examination, without this transaction, the consequences would be unimaginable. When he was sent to the rocket, the rocket looked down on him and directly traded him for oradibo. As a result, it was nothing! And come to the walker's lewell, finally adversity rebirth, gorgeous bloom. It seems that he is very pitiful, but he has defeated death, and now he has a firm foothold in the walkers, which is the biggest reward for him!
