The wizard finally won! Bill came back, hiromura came back, and the wizard beat magic 131-116, ending a four game losing streak. Wei Shao 38 minutes, 11 in 8, 3 in 3, a total of 23 points, 14 rebounds, 15 assists, the efficiency is terrible. After the game, ESPN listed a set of data. Williams won 20 triple doubles this season. While constantly breaking the record of the Wizards in single season, he created an embarrassing record. In the 20 games in which he won the triple doubles, the wizard's record was 9-11. In the history of NBA, before Wei Shao, no one has ever won more than 10 triple doubles in a single season, and the winning rate is less than 50%. Wei Shao has created such an embarrassing record and become the first person in the history of NBA!

Is it possible for Neville to raise his winning rate of triple doubles to more than 50% before the end of the season? Otherwise, it will be recorded in history forever! To be honest, it's very, very difficult. The current record of the wizard is 18-32. What's the level of the teams with similar record? Cavaliers, this season has been trying to put bad, send off Zhuang God, Lok Fu Long truce, as long as together 8 people to play, win or lose does not matter. There is magic, the trading window period to send off the team's four main players, face on the three words "don't play"! And the pistons, their labels are rotten. Why? The Wizards have the top assists (weishao) + top scorers (bill) + three doubles (weishao), but their record is the fifth from the bottom in the league?

We are tired of the three doubles in every game. Weishao, who used to be in the thunder period, can average 30 + triple doubles per game. He can average triple doubles for three consecutive seasons. Triple doubles per game helps him win the MVP, make him stand on the top of the league and become a superstar. However, weishao, who is 32 years old, is still playing in the 22-year-old way. Break through with the ball, throw yourself into the crowd and force to attack the box; constantly try zombies to pull out the middle shot, try to lead the team in any aspect, rebound, defense, pass, score, do everything yourself, lose the game, he will take the initiative to take responsibility, like a stubborn teenager. Some fans say that weishao has harmed the wizard. Last season, the wizard didn't have weishao. The final winning rate of the season was 34.7%. This season, weishao has won 36% of the games. Bill has been absent for eight games, so we can't blame weishao. He tried his best, but he is not the boy he used to be.

This season, the proportion of shots from the basket this season is about 17%, while the proportion of shots from the basket in his career is about 35%. The prodigy really can't help ah Dou. The team's three-point hit rate is 34.7%, ranking 25th in the league. The team has 535 three-point hits, ranking 28th in the league. Even if the Wizards get two more shooters in the off-season or window period, and Wei Shao gives three more assists per game, the Wizards may have to win two more games, but the configuration of the Wizards is not good. Most of the time Wei Shao is not present, they fight separately, and the scene is quite chaotic. However, Wei Shao's inefficient hit rate and contribution value have become one of the short boards that limit the team's progress. After all, Wei Shao is never a star who relies on projection. At the end of his career, his defects are magnified infinitely.

In the summer of 2016, thunder was overturned by the warriors. Durant and Wei Shao vowed the day before that they would not leave thunder and would continue to fight with him. The next day they announced that they would join the warriors. Yes, Wei Shao is a good partner, must be a good brother off the field, but his defects can't make the team win the championship. At that time, he really cared about the data, 9 help not attack, 9 board not defend, with emotional, very paranoid, he often made the wrong projection choice at the critical moment, thunder lost the game more than once. After joining the warriors, Durant announced the end of the league. The warriors of those two years really became a nightmare for many teams. Durant also broke the balance of the game between Zhan and the former warriors.

After the Rockets were eliminated by the Lakers in the autumn of 20 years, harden said, "we're missing a key player." In that round of series, or in the eight games in which weishao played, he didn't provide any help to harden. He averaged 17.9 points, 7 rebounds, 4.6 assists and 3.8 turnovers. His shooting percentage was 42.1%, and his three-point shooting percentage was 24.2%. He was doubted by Jen and Davis. Weishao becomes the last straw to crush harden. Harden finally understands that the Rockets are only trying to please themselves in exchange for weishao to send Paul away. However, weishao harden's group of two brothers is far away from the championship. The key lies in weishao's short board. During the off-season, harden and Durant trained together, and they were fighting to leave the Rockets, and finally they got what they wanted. The arrival of harden prompted Griffin and Adelaide to join in later. Former Durant and later harden joined hands to make the League enter the final state again.

Wei Shao has done nothing wrong. He has been used to playing and living in this way for a long time. He is honest, hardworking and hard-working. He's right, but he's not a good companion on chongguan road in the era of fast food.
