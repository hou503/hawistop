With the closing day getting closer and closer, more and more trading rumors appear, but unexpectedly, the Lakers have become one of the potential trading teams. The current record of the Lakers is 28-15, ranking third in the Western Conference, but I'm afraid the third place can't be kept. In this case, "bleachers" reporter fescher reported that the Hornets had inquired about Harrell, the Lakers are willing to listen to any offer about Harrell. It's not over yet. Veteran Zhan's reporter wenderhorst confirmed that it's no secret for the Lakers to sell pop. At this stage, the Lakers don't want pop.

Let's talk about Harrell first. This season, he has played 43 games on behalf of the Lakers, with an average of 24.8 minutes, 14.7 points + 6.6 rebounds, and a shooting percentage of 64.1%. Although he failed to reach the average of 19 points last season, his efficiency is improving because of the decrease of shots. When the Lakers signed him, two years later, for Harrell, he could get a higher price from the free market, which belongs to the friendship price. In the past five games, 27 points have been scored against warriors, 25 points against Timberwolves, 23 points against hawks and 23 points against suns. Harrell is now the most stable scoring point of the Lakers, and has no one. If the Lakers trade him, can they start to rot like the Rockets?

Let's talk about the "hero" pop who led to the collapse of the off-season of the Lakers. This season, Popper averaged 26.1 minutes, can get 8.4 points + 2.4 rebounds + 1.4 assists, the shooting percentage is 42.9%, and the three-point shooting percentage is 40.3%. According to the data, Popper's performance is barely passable, but the deep digging can not satisfy the fans. This season, Popper has only scored 57 three-point goals, as the most accurate three-point shooter in the Laker team, he can only score 1.5 points per game Three points, which is the key reason why the Lakers can't find the form of the outside line this season. Pop did not dare to move, only old Zhan and Kuzma insisted on moving. In the four years since pop came to the Lakers, the data has plummeted, including in the playoffs of last season. He has been playing the role of icing on the cake, rather than providing timely help.

Michael menaming has updated Jen's latest injury report. According to the preliminary estimate, James will be absent for at least 3-4 weeks, and this is still an ideal situation. The Lakers need to try various treatments. In the 48 hours after James was injured, he went with the team to Phoenix. He wanted to stabilize the morale of the army, and he sent a signal to the team that he was still here. But when he returns to Los Angeles, he needs to undergo a comprehensive examination, which means that he will be absent for at least 13-15 games in a tight schedule. When he comes back, there are only about 10 games left for the Lakers and James. What about Davis? Now the whole team are not sure, Davis injury did not return!

The next schedule of the Lakers ranked fifth in the league. At present, the Lakers are 2.5 games ahead of the sixth place blazers, and 7-10 places will play a playoff. In the absence of James and Nongmei this season, the Lakers are 0-2. American media "538" updated the ranking of the Lakers after their record was affected due to the injury of Zhan Mei, which is probably the sixth or seventh in the western region. If Davis is absent for a long time, the Lakers may fall to the eighth or even later. The Lakers hope Davis will be back when he plays against the Clippers before April 4, which is very important for the ranking. But now, it's unrealistic. The Lakers are no longer qualified to compete with the Clippers for the ranking. The Lakers need to rely on the Spurs, the lone ranger and the warriors to win fewer games.

So the Lakers are in a hurry. The management of the Lakers said they were confident of Zhuang Shen, and also aimed at some guards. In fact, the Lakers dug a big hole for themselves in the off-season, because of the delay in renewing their contract with Pope, which led to Howard's departure, Rondo's departure and Bradley's departure, including sending away McKee to give little Gasol space. The price of pop's final contract extension is not high. It has been proved that if the contract is renewed at this price, the Lakers have a good chance to keep Howard. If they don't sign Harrell, the Lakers have a good chance to keep the main frame lineup of last season. They just replace green with Schroeder, but the quality of attack and defense of the Lakers has not declined. But the reality is, last season's lineup can't be short of Shawn brow and Jen, so the Lakers want to change!

To put it bluntly, although the Lakers signed a five-year $190 million contract with Davis and a two-year $85 million contract with Jensen, they want to quickly complete the replacement of the old and the new in this season and rely on Jensen's strong team to defend their title! Harrell and Schroeder are the most obvious examples, because they both have the ability to average 20 points per game and can score in the absence of Davis. However, when the salary of the Lakers is limited, it's just that the east wall has been removed and the west wall has been replaced, the scorer has been found, the guard frame has not been built, the chemical reaction has not been established, and the important role players in the championship period have been lost. There is only one sleepwalking pop who regrets after giving the contract. In fact, the current Lakers, more and more far away from the championship.
