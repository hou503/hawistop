After the end of the trading window, as the thunder of the largest Lakers, but nothing. In fact, the Lakers had a chance to get Lori, and they were willing to take out pop + Schroeder for Lori, but the Raptors offered to join Tucker, and the Lakers refused, and finally Lori stayed with the Raptors. There's nothing in the market. Now the Lakers have to wait to buy out the market, but there's no good news.

In the past 10 days, several teams who want to win the championship have not given up the chance to strengthen. The heat, in exchange for beliza to enhance the height of the inside line, swap Bradley + orinico + the first round to get oradibo, and swap Leonard + the second round to get Ariza, which are almost all empty handed trading with white wolves. Now they buy out the big fish Adelaide, they also want to join the heat! And the heat after these several reinforcement, the strength increased! Starting: oradipo + Nann + Butler + (Adelaide) + Gerba, there are Ariza, Dragic, beliza, igodara, Hiro, Duncan Robinson on the bench, the heat's lineup has been perfect, with height, ball holder, forward defender, ball control organizer and shooter. Compared with the lineup that reached the finals last season, the heat's lineup this season is better It's even more terrifying.

Of course, you can't forget the nets. Although the nets in the trading window period is not too big action, but put all the mind on the buyout market. According to the latest report of Hayes, in addition to listing the Knicks and the Lakers as the most likely next choice, Chuang Shen also has the clippers, the green army and the nets as his options. In addition, azley Johnson, the new signing of the nets, scored 23 points and 15 rebounds in the first game on behalf of the nets. Under the leadership of harden, the role players have been greatly improved. There are also four rotation players in the interior, including Clarkston, Griffin, little Jordan and Jeff Green. There are two special cases available in the hands of the nets. If they get Zhuang Shen again, the League will have a big ending.

And the biggest winner of the deadline can be called nuggets! Nuggets with Hartenstein + two rounds of signing in exchange for McKee, increase the height of the inside line and impact, Jokic finally has a substitute who can contribute to the game. In addition, they use Harris + Hampton + the first round to sign the empty glove white wolf in exchange for Gordon and Clark. This new Nuggets is more terrible: Porter, Murray, Jokic, Gordon four, their paper strength is not inferior to any team in the league. Previously, the Nuggets' weak link was the position of power forward. Millsap was old and couldn't withstand the opponent's attack. In the past three seasons, Gordon restricted the opponent's hit rate to 13th among the players who defended more than 1500 shots! In addition, this season Gordon's three-point shooting rate and assists are career high, Nuggets picked up a star for nothing, they are not afraid of the Lakers now.

The Clippers are more unexpected. If you want to pursue Lori, you don't have the right chips. If they want to pursue Bauer, they have no suitable chips and are forced to lower their own standards. Soon, they use Luwei + two rounds of signing + part of cash to exchange Rondo. For the clippers, this deal is like insurance for their playoffs! Rondo can recuperate well in the regular season, play in the playoffs, control the rhythm of the team in the playoffs, share the pressure of Cary and George, and feed the best three-point team in the league. It seems that the clippers have made two rounds of signing, which is a big loss, but not suitable. Rondo is a necessity for the clippers, which is the key for the Clippers to challenge the Lakers in the playoffs.

Including the Blazers, they also empty handed set white wolf, with little Trent + hood easily in exchange for the Raptors field average 19 points and 3 rebounds of valiant Powell, and bucks, early trade, send off Augustine, Craig and other players can not play, in exchange for Tucker, began to polish the lineup for the playoffs. Even the 76ers who are the first in the East are working hard. They get George Hill through the trade to further improve the stability of the bench. George Hill's experience can also help this young team. The seven giants have strengthened one after another, and the Lakers have achieved nothing!

In fact, it's understandable for the Lakers to focus on the buyout market, but it's also a pity for the Lakers to miss Lori. In James' absence days, if the Lakers continue to lose in a row, even the playoffs will become an extravagant hope, and James also needs a stable outside assistant to hold the ball. Lori is old, but wins with rich experience, good defense and strong ability in series. In order to keep Tucker, the Lakers rejected Lori, which is disappointing. Of course, if the Lakers lose all the time in a row, there will be little time left for Jen to recover. If the Lakers really fall out of six places, Jen's character will not be ignored. And now the Lakers in the eyes of Adelaide and Zhuangshen, the whole league are staring at, the Lakers how to compete with the heat, the Knicks, the green army and the nets? The Lakers are so hard!
