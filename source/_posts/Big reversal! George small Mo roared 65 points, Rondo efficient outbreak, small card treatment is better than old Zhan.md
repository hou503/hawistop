Pistons this team is really more terrible, meet strong is strong! In fact, in the first half, including the third quarter, they all took the lead. Their tough defense forced the Clippers to make more mistakes, fiercely rush for rebounds, including the cooperative defense, pinch, steal and counterattack. They didn't look like the bottom in the East. However, when the Clippers improved their defensive strength in the fourth quarter, the pistons still looked a little immature, and grant was not there. They really lacked a team It's the end of a strong point.

The Clippers really unreasonable, small card rotation, Ibaka continue to heal, indeed, Reggie today too many mistakes let the Clippers in a passive scene, but little Morris efficiency is very high, 18 in 13, including three-point ball 8 in 6, get 33 points, and Batum led Rondo + Mann three substitutes play the role of chasing points, Rondo series feeding ability, Batum no solution three points, plus Zuma Bartz's threat from inside, Morris's three-point threat from two flanks, and the Clippers' pursuit of points are also a wave. George is slowly getting back to form, and teren Lu is also continuing to increase Rondo's playing time. The Clippers now have no short board, which is the biggest enemy of the Western Laker. To tell you the truth, the Clippers' overall strength is too strong without the combination of cajiao and Zhan Mei. The treatment of small card is better than that of old Zhan.
