Due to the lack of players in the Lakers, Matthews, who should have been suspended, continued to play this game. At the end of the first quarter of the game, Matthews broke through with the ball and hit the basket when he fell to the ground. The injured position was still his neck. Matthews failed to get up for a long time. After the game, according to team reporter trudel, Matthews X-ray was negative and there was no structural damage. The Lakers are now really no longer available in the backcourt, starting with Schroeder and Popper, and only kaluso, Tucker and Matthews are left on the bench.

Pau Gasol, who had refused to be interviewed because of Zhuang Shen's arrival, also had a good performance. Although he made five mistakes, he did help the team by protecting the frame and passing the ball. After today's game, he finally accepted his current role: "everything can change in the NBA, I know I want to help the team. It's hard to accept the current situation. I know it may be out of rotation, but I have to accept the reality. It's your job. You need to devote yourself to it. It's not easy. " For Gasol, in fact, from Vogel to his teammates, give him a lot of encouragement, he needs to seize the opportunity given to him by the team, so no one can replace you. The good news is that little Gasol is slowly accepting his present role. I hope he can play well. Unity is the most basic premise for the championship!
