In the second half of the NBA regular season, the Lakers and the nets are competing to buy out two big fish in the market: Adelaide and Zhuang Shen. In fact, these two teams are most likely to win the championship this season. The biggest short board of the net is the inside line, while the Lakers need the blue collar center to protect the frame. In today's small ball era, although the position of shuangnengwei including small forward is very popular, the league's top super giant old Zhan, Durant and xiaoka are all in the No. 3 position, but the single wire does not form a line, and the single wood does not form a forest. If you want to go to the end, you must have a strong internal strength. Who is the best center in the league today? Of course, Jokic and nbid are now competing for MVP, and there is a player who has gradually grown into a first-line star in the league. He is the old rocket general Capella.

The eagles have had a good start to the season, winning in a row in the first three games in the East. This was followed by a series of defeats and infighting, falling to the 13th place in the East. The Hawks management made up their mind to fire pierce and help Macmillan to take over. After the change of manager, the tough coach led the Hawks to take off again. After the change of manager, the Hawks won seven consecutive games and came back to the fifth place in the east from the 11th in the East, ranking second only to the nets, 76ers, bucks and heat. Their paper strength is not weak, the most important thing is to improve the defensive end. After getting Capella, their defensive efficiency has improved significantly this season. In the words of new manager McMillan, Capella is the future all star, the best defensive player.

Capella has played 35 games on behalf of the team this season, averaging 14.6 points + 14.1 rebounds + 2.3 blocks, and the shooting percentage is 59.2%. Capella's data performance is very amazing, averaging 4.9 rebounds per game, 16% rebounds per field, and ranking first in the league! Capella's front rebounding rate is higher than Harrell's and Gasol's back rebounding rate. In short, Capella grabs the front rebounding, just like visiting his own back garden. In addition, Capella's game contribution value is as high as 16.5, ranking 14th in the league, and his game contribution value is similar to Davis, Durant, Carlos and Lillard. Don't be surprised, the change that the defensive side brings to the team is more terrible than the offensive side.

In fact, Capella is now the representative of the top five centers in the league, with an average of 11.4 interference shots, the seventh in the league, 9.7 interference two-point shots, the sixth in the league, 3.1 card position, the ninth in the league, and 2.9 cover assists, the 28th in the league. Thanks to harden's training. At that time, Capella just came to the Rockets, there was no stable playing time, harden suggested the team use Capella, and after Capella entered the starting line-up, harden increased his pick and roll tactics, eating cake is always an ability! If he is not surrounded by Trey young, but James or harden, imagine how comfortable it would be for Capella to pick and roll from a high position and then go straight down, old Jen to throw a high shot and Capella to dunk easily from the inside. In fact, Capella is able to play 30 minutes Howard, but the Lakers did not keep Howard.

And even in the eagles this does not have much support and help of the team, Capella is still constantly breaking the team history record! He has five games in a row to grab at least 15 rebounds, in 2001 after Mutombo team first! In the game with Timberwolves, Capella sent three doubles of 13 points, 19 rebounds and 10 blocks. He became the second player to get three doubles of blocks in the past five years, and the other one was Anthony Davis. Capella has 9 consecutive games to get 10 rebounds + 2 block, level Mutombo team history record; and the pistons game, Capella shot 27 points, 26 rebounds and 5 block, he became the first after O'Neill in 2004, to achieve 25 + 25 + 5 cap player! He once got 40 points, 45 rebounds and 15 blocks in two consecutive back-to-back games. He became the second player in NBA history to send 45 rebounds and 15 blocks in two consecutive games since Jabbar! The pistons got 15 rebounds at half-time. He became the Hawks' first 15 + rebounder at half-time after Howard!

On the defensive side, you can always trust Capella. In the rocket era, all fans remember Capella was teased by green and curry, but ignored that he played against Downes and gobel. They all said that Capella did not have the ability to attack with the ball, but in the three second area or even within three meters of the basket, Capella's effective shooting percentage exceeded 65%, and Zhuang Shen and gobel could not reach this level! At the beginning, the Rockets sent Capella away in exchange for Covington, saying that it was to make room for weishao's impact under the basket, but in fact it was for tax avoidance, so they missed the league's top five center trained by themselves! What chips did the Hawks pay when they got Capella? A Turner's premium contract + a protected first round signing!

To be honest, now in the Hawks, Capella is a bit of a stooper. If he can go to the nets or the Lakers, he must have a higher upper limit. Players who can protect rebounds are very popular everywhere. Of course, if he really has the chance to join hands with harden in the future, the League will come to a big end. Today's Capella is not that green little guy, he can dominate the inside line!
