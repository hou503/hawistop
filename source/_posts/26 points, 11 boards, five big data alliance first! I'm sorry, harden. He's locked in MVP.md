This season, the League situation is really chaotic. Compared with the tripartite confrontation in the eastern region, the western region is now in a state of chaos. The Jazz suns firmly hold the top two, the Clippers nuggets, the Lakers blazers, and there is only a gap of two wins. One thing is certain that the overall competitiveness of the top six in the western region is not weak. It can be said that the dominance of the clippers and the Lakers has declined in this season's regular season, or it can be said that it is the whole team Whether the physical strength rises or not, there is a great suspense in the west this season, and the Los Angeles twins are struggling. Recently, the Lakers lost to the clippers, Nuggets beat the magic, Nuggets replaced the Lakers into the top four, and they are only one win away from the clippers, familiar Nuggets back.

Nuggets have made steady progress in the past three seasons. Last season, Nuggets also entered the Western Conference, which has the most direct relationship with Jokic. It seems that fat people and animals are harmless, but Jokic's growth and progress is really a footprint every year. In the 15-16 season, when he first entered the league, he averaged 10 points and 7 rebounds per game. In the second season, he was able to send the data of 16.7 points, 9.8 rebounds and 4.9 assists per game. In the past three seasons, joachi stabilized the data output of 20 + 10 + 7 per game. In this season, joachi played 35.7 minutes per game, and was able to send the data of 26.3 points, 11 rebounds, 8.6 assists and 1.5 steals per game! Can you imagine the fat teacher playing 1748 minutes this season, ranking second in the league? (second only to Randall) can you imagine that Mr. Yue, who is slowly taking the fifth place in the league, is on the same level as Cary and Covington, only three times less than first place McConnell? What is more unexpected is his high-level data.

This season, Jokic's per efficiency is the first in the league, standard victory contribution value and victory contribution value every 48 minutes are the first in the league, BPM (player per 100 rounds compared with the league average performance difference) is the first in the league, vorp (player irreplaceable value) is the first in the League! Maybe you don't have a clear standard to measure these vague words. Let's take a look at the gap between other people and him! So far this season, joachi's contribution to victory is 10.7, followed by Gerber and Letterman, both of which are 7.3. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the biggest gap between the first and second place is 3.4. The last appearance can be traced back to the 15-16 season. That year, MVP curry was 3.4 ahead of the second place, and curry was undoubtedly elected MVP. In addition, Jokic's contribution to victory is much higher than that of enbid and Jen! In terms of the team's real winning and losing value, Jokic's performance this season can rank sixth in history, only lagging behind Jordan's three consecutive championship period, curry's all vote MVP period and James in the 2008-09 season.

The data don't lie. This season, when Jokic was on the field, the Nuggets could get 17.5 points more in every 100 rounds of attack. Although the defensive end lost 8 points more in every 100 rounds, who can limit him now in the west? Is it the more inflexible Gerber, or the Lakers' little plus or Johnson? Or is it the soft center of the sun? Jokic's data is impeccable. Scoring League ninth, rebounding League eighth, assists League sixth, steals League eighth, three-point shooting League 13th, shooting League 11th, offensive efficiency League third, game contribution League second, and his card League fifth, truncation League sixth, interference shooting League top 20, with "Sports Illustrated" reporter Pena's words, NBA history has never been There is no such all-around inside as joachi, you can determine that No. 41 ranked him in history.

I'm sorry, harden. Although it's really tough for you to take the net to the first place in the East with Durant's long injury and Owen's stop and go situation this season, it's really hard for the League to give you the MVP. There are many reasons. The most important thing is that the way you left the rockets at the beginning had a bad impact on the super giant core of other teams. Although the League was big and small at the beginning, it is not difficult to see from the MVP list that even if you get the best in the East for two consecutive months, you just entered the top three of the MVP list in order to lead the team and fight for injury. After all, the nets are Owen and Duran He was the first to be king. Compared with harden, joachi is a well-established young man with a grass-roots background. He grows up step by step, without much negative news and is very young. The League needs this kind of benchmarking to create new leaders for the post James era, like the Letterman of the past two years, and the Jokic of today.

Looking forward to the playoffs, to be honest, Nuggets is really the biggest potential stock in the western region this season. Last season, they reversed the jazz and the clippers, not all by luck. They were able to suppress Carlos and George for three consecutive games, and force the attacking and defending all-round clippers to collapse in the second half. First of all, their team strength is not weak. Second, Murray and Jokic are two strong points, which are easy to be ignored. In fact, they have already grown into all stars or even super giants. It's not easy for the Lakers to win the Western Conference. There are Davis's three-point winner and Howard's success. Now that Howard leaves, Jokic has no natural enemies. In addition, they have added Gordon. On the one hand, Jokic is locking in the MVP. What if they reach the finals in the end?
