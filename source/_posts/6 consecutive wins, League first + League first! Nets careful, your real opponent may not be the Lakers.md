Since the Lakers won the championship last season, many of the hot spots this season have started an arms race. The Bucks have signed Portis, Forbes, Holliday and others. The 76ers have also brought in green, Howard and little curry. Needless to say, the nets are the biggest hot team in the championship. The West has become the world of jazz and Suns. The two teams now dominate the top two, while the Lakers are dominated by the West James and Davis are now fourth in the West. Who's playing against whom in this season's finals? I believe most of the fans would like to see the Lakers compete with the nets, but there is one team that can't be underestimated. They are too strong now. Who? The clipper led by xiaoka.

In the last two games, the Clippers first won 122-112 over the 76ers in the East, and then 129-105 over the Bucks led by brother Letterman, and won six consecutive games. During the six consecutive games, the Clippers won at least two figures in five games, and each game had an average of 2-3 starters missing: Beverly and Ibaka had been injured, truce, spurs and Carra rest; bucks, George Even so, they beat the eastern Blackhorse Hornets by 27 points, the eastern Blackhorse hawks by 22 points, the Spurs by 33 points and the Spurs by 13 points, including beating the 76ers and bucks! According to the statistics of Sean Yang, the current attack efficiency of the clippers is 117.4, ranking first in the League! The nets came in second at 117.2, Nuggets third at 117 and jazz fourth at 116.9.

They are really a very unreasonable team. The three-point shooting rate is still maintained at 41.9%. They have hit more than 40% for four months in a row. They are the first in the league and the first in the free throw shooting rate. Their gains and losses are ranked in the top six in the league. Only two teams in the league can make the top six in the net efficiency value of attack and defense at the same time. One is jazz, the other is clippers! The Bucks game is a clear example. The Bucks got 38 points in the first quarter, and only 67 points in the last three quarters when the Clippers improved their defensive strength! The clippers have won at least 20 points in 11 times this season, the most in the League! The efficiency of attack is the first in the league and the number of wins is the first in the league. Why did the Clippers change this season? Or because of Leonard and George.

In fact, Leonard's data is not outstanding, there is no way to compare with harden, Jokic and Xingge, averaging 25.9 points + 6.3 rebounds + 4.9 assists per game, with a shooting percentage of 51.5%. However, Leonard's offensive efficiency is 121.8, ranking first in the League! This has a lot to do with Terence Lu. Terence Lu is used to putting the best players on the field all the time. Leonard's playing time this season has also reached a new career high, reaching 34.5 minutes. When Leonard is on the field, the opponent's single marking has no effect. As long as Leonard is pinched, he habitually gives the ball to create opportunities for his teammates, and many of his teammates are distracted Hand: young Morris's 46.6% three-point shot, Reggie's 42.8% shot, George's 42.6% shot, bartum's 42.8% shot, Kennard's 48.9% shot, which is unreasonable!

And tyrenlu does dare to let go of people, like to use and small card and George have a chemical reaction with the players. For example, young man scored 16 points against Hornets, 21 points against eagles, 23 points against 76ers and 14 points against bucks. The defensive end is like a mad dog, not inferior to Beverly, young, but energetic. Attack dare to shoot dare to sudden, the most important thing is willing to run through the constant pull opponent defense, which can be very easy to get the opportunity in the small card side! And Kennard, who was criticized by clippers fans for not making any contribution to attack and defense, played the eagles and scored 20 points in 8 of the game, leading the big reversal! Playing bucks, four three-point shots in the fourth quarter stunned the opponent, with 21 points in 8 of 11. In fact, Kennard has no problem with his attitude, and he works hard enough. The most important thing is that he has to have a certain number of shots, which is not a problem here.

For comparison, taking the nets as an example, harden doesn't want to be the main attack point of the team. In the regular season, he must let his teammates play, temper, and be ready for the playoffs. But Owen plays stop and play, Durant heals for a long time, harden doesn't have the conditions for both There are not so many stable shooters around. In contrast, small card and George data is not gorgeous, a game ten or twenty points, but the clipper often can win, when Leonard and George no longer load management, the clipper is on the right track! Don't forget that Rondo has joined us, which is the key for the Clippers to raise the upper limit in the playoffs!

Give the Clippers another chance, they may not lose nuggets, compared with last season, they sent Wayne and Harrell this season, completely around the combination of Capello team, the effect is very good! If the Clippers beat the Lakers, it shouldn't be a surprise. But this year, it's too cruel for Jen. There are the improving Clippers in the West and the galaxy battleship nets in the East. This is the biggest test for Jen, who is 36 years old!
