At the beginning of the game, Huo ledi took six points from the basket in a row. After the two minute blackout, the big Morris finally shot three points to stop bleeding. After that, Zhuang Shen threw to get the first point of the Laker's career. In the middle of the game, the Lakers suddenly broke out.

The third quarter back, Harrell and Schroeder try to chase points, and the letter of Corinna 6 points continue to expand the difference. Vogel called for a time-out in succession, and Zhuang Shen was forced to leave. The Lakers were about to collapse when Harrell stepped forward and scored 11 points under the basket, leading the Lakers to narrow the score to about 10 points. The second half of the letter, brother took turns to attack the basket, Huo ledi shot in vain, played three quarters, Bucks 89-75 Lakers.

In 14 minutes, 2 of 6 shots, 2 free throws, 4 points, 1 rebound, 2 assists, 1 block, 3 mistakes and 4 fouls. Chuang Shen's first show of the Lakers was like little Gasol. He was also killed in the game by the letter brother to finish the violent dunk and didn't get the rebound. But in the competition, Zhuang Shen's right toenail also fell off, and unexpectedly withdrew from the competition. Maybe in the view of the Lakers, Zhuang Shen should be an enhanced version of Howard, with the ability to protect the frame, better personality, eat cakes and make fewer mistakes. But to be honest, when Zhuang Shen is on the scene, the pace of the Lakers is also slowing down, and Zhuang Shen and his teammates seem to lack tacit understanding. Take your time. The Lakers can't always make up one mistake for another.

In fact, the Bucks didn't perform well today. The letter brother made mistakes quickly in double, and Middleton's hand feeling was relatively general. The Lakers were just not good at attacking. Of course, they can't rely on Zhuang Shen at this stage. Zhuang Shen's data is very good, but the effect on the court is not so good. Didn't Schroeder refuse the four-year 84 million contract extension of the Lakers? Then he should match his salary level. If you want to get 30 million, you want to get the top salary, 6 out of 18, only 17 points and 8 assists. This data is far from enough! I hope the Lakers can hold the top six in the western conference before Jens comes back, otherwise it will be too hard!
