To be honest, the Lakers played really well today! Three people who have been in the center of trading rumors before: Harrell, Schroeder and Popper. No matter how much psychological pressure they have suffered before, at least today their attitude and fighting spirit are praiseworthy. Harrell's strong attack, Popper's ability to shoot, Schroeder constantly feeds Kuzma, Morris and Haler. Although there is no James and Davis, this Laker is in this wave In the process of losing in a row, people see hope, which is the most important thing. The Lakers are not afraid to lose, but they have to get something. In addition, Kuzma is now the absolute core of the Laker. In the fourth quarter, he made up a three-point deduction at a critical moment, including making fouls. He led the team to catch up with only three points short. Although the ball lost, the Laker players can leave the arena today with their heads held high!

Enbid was injured, Bradley and puye were traded, Howard was expelled, and the 76ers had no center. The 76ers really hope to get Lori at the last moment of the window period, and their agents have told green that they are ready to leave the team, but in the end, the 76ers did not complete the deal. They don't need too much adjustment and change in this team now. After getting George Hill from the bench, there is a veteran who has come down. Now they are enough to compete with the nets. With the deepening of the schedule, Denny green and little curry are getting better and better. Don't forget that they still lack enbid. Of course, from an emotional point of view, I hope the 76ers will be eliminated in the first round of the playoffs, which will not affect us to watch the Eastern Conference semi-finals or the Eastern Conference finals.
