This season's NBA regular season is really too difficult. It's extremely unfriendly for the players or veterans with glass attributes. They play every two days on average. They often play back-to-back, including the lack of people due to the health and safety agreement, isolation and so on. It really needs plenty of family to achieve good results in this environment. Jen and Davis were injured at the same time. The future of the Lakers is uncertain. The Clippers' fourth place is difficult to guarantee. It's too chaotic. The eastern 76ers have been competing with the nets for nearly a month, but the Bucks have become the biggest winner. Up to now, the bucks are only 1.5 games away from the top 76ers and 0.5 games away from the nets.

The League released the latest MVP list. Joachi climbed to the top with an average of 27 points, 11 rebounds and 8.6 assists per game. Lilard climbed from the fourth place to the second with an average of 30.6 points, 4.5 rebounds and 7.8 assists per game. However, the third place was somewhat surprising. Letterman jumped up like a rocket from the seventh place in the previous period, averaging 29.1 points, 11.8 rebounds, 6.2 assists, 1.3 steals and 1.3 blocks so far this season. Jen and enbid were pushed to fourth and fifth places, with harden in sixth place. This list is actually very interesting. The top two in the list, joachic and Lillard, are only the fifth and sixth core teams in the West. They want to get the MVP, at least in the top four of the division. However, it is very difficult for the Nuggets and the Blazers to get into the top four, unless they crowd out the lack of Jamie's team or the clippers of Calo. Of course, in the past few years, both of them have never been popular candidates for MVP, and League supporters have to choose those with high degree of topic.

In the past five games, he averaged 29.2 points, 11.8 rebounds, 10.2 assists and 1.0 steals. The efficiency was terrible. The shooting percentage was 60%, the three-point percentage was 41.2%, and the free throw percentage was 86.1%! The letter brother became the third player in NBA history who got three doubles in five consecutive games and hit 60% of the field. Before that, the two players were Chamberlain and Robertson. Consciously, both of them got the final MVP in the season before they achieved this achievement! In the game against the Spurs, Letterman scored 9 of 18, scored 26 points, 8 rebounds and 15 assists. He became the fourth bucks player in the history to score at least 25 points and 15 assists in a single game. The other three players were Robertson, Rogers and montaellis.

It must be admitted that brother letterman's physical talent conditions are really outstanding. He seldom gets injured. Especially in the last three seasons, Bucks coach budenhower's use of Letterman has reached an extreme. Basically controlled within 30 minutes, all the ball rights are given to you. 80% of the teams in the league can't resist the impact of brother Letterman holding the ball. This is also the main reason why brother Letterman easily won the MVP in the past two seasons. Good data, wonderful playing, outstanding team performance, you want to give him MVP, that at least has a reason to go? He said he was a playoff player, but MVP only looks at the regular season. Old Zhan's data is not as outstanding as his. Harden's way of playing has been criticized. Only brother Letterman has no defects except that his projection is a hard short board.

In fact, this season, the original letter brother should fall off the altar, because his regular season this kind of play has been more and more attention of the team, this season the bucks in the situation behind is often difficult to turn over. And this season's MVP most popular enbid, averaging 30 points, 11.5 rebounds, 3.3 assists and 1.4 blocks. If he leads the 76ers to hold the first place in the East, the MVP is basically in the bag, but because of a knee injury, he will be absent for about 2-3 weeks. When he comes back, if the 76ers are still the first, enbid's MVP voice will be reduced, because he is not the same as him. If he comes back and the 76ers fall out of the top two, the voice of nbid's MVP will be lower, because brother letterman's data and team performance are better than you, and he has played more games than you. Why not give brother Letterman?

And James. In the first four issues of MVP this season, Jen won the first place. Indeed, at the age of 36, a stable output of 25 + 8 + 8, leading the Lakers to occupy the top two in the Western Conference for a long time, which is convincing enough. Moreover, the consensus reached by the whole league last year is that Jen's MVP was stolen by brother Letterman. Durant and Lillard are all supporting Jen and condemning the unfair practices of the alliance. And this season, James did get the attention of the League again, but with Davis injured, the record of the Lakers fluctuated, and now it is not easy for the Lakers to stabilize, James injured again. James once said that I should not only get four MVPs. If I can get MVPs, why not (compete)? Of course James wants to, but it's time and luck.

In short, if the Bucks continue to win in a row (their schedule is really good in the future), they can compete for the first place in the East, and they can guarantee 30 + 10 + 10 output per game! Enbid was injured, Jen was also injured, and harden was a father and a mother. He worked hard to lead the team, but the League didn't approve of it. Who let you break the pot at the beginning, which led to many teams in the League worried that the core would be affected by you and considered joining the team? Harden is too tired to get into the top five! Even if harden can lead the nets to occupy the first place in the East, as long as the Bucks led by brother Letterman are stable in the top three in the East, it is very likely that brother Letterman will laugh to the end. After all, one person, one city, and the data are gorgeous. As for the playoffs, who cares! The tide is fading, the letter brother is the biggest winner!
