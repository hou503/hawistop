At the beginning, the letter brother made a strong attack under the basket, shot in the middle and three-point shot to win the team's first seven points, while the Clippers relied on Leonard and Reggie to grasp the score, Reggie's three-point ball in the middle and Carlos' counter attack layup to help the Clippers open the scoring gap.

I tried my best! Today, the letter brother 34 minutes, 21 in 10, got 32 points, 6 rebounds, 3 assists, but lost 31 points! As a matter of fact, the tactics tylenlu arranged for the Clippers are basically the same as those encountered by the letter elder brother in the past few years. Let the letter elder brother break through, give the letter elder brother physical confrontation, and cut off the practice of the letter elder brother and his teammates. This kind of playing method will make other bucks players hard to play, and the letter elder brother may not be able to get 2 points when he encounters all kinds of resistance in each round of attack, and the Clippers will score 19 points in the whole court The gap is obvious. But Middleton has not achieved anything. Leonard has been keeping a close eye on him. Huoledi is in good condition, but the ball power is limited. The bucks are really embarrassed now. After the game, the gap between the bucks and the nets widened to 2 wins. The nets now have no pursuers, and there is only one 76er in front.

Since sending away Dewey, Mann and Kennard take turns breaking out! In fact, Mann has great impact, has three-point range, is young and dares to fight. He also likes to feed zubaz and Batum. He is really a young player who can be trained. And Leonard today all focus on the defensive end, in addition to sending the team's highest eight assists, really revitalized the team, when the Bucks attack Leonard, young Morris, Kennard and Reggie are all big vacancies, three people together into 13 three-point ball, clippers four strong to get 89 points, this is the letter brother and Leonard's gap. Basketball, after all, is a game of five people, not a fight of one person, unless you are harden.
