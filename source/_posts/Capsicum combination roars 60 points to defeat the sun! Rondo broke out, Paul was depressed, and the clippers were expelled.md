At the decisive moment, George continued to score three points. After bridges responded to the three points, Rondo scored three points to lock in the victory, and little Morris was also expelled!

To be honest, although the two teams did not have much grudge before, the smell of gunpowder was very strong. In the third section, when Leonard started to break out, it was unnecessary for buck to bump into people when he ate bridge alone. In the fourth quarter, Beverly and Claude's physical contact, including George's dissatisfaction with Booker's excessive action, entangled with each other, both teams must be particularly angry. But one thing is for sure, when the Clippers defensive strength, the entire sun side, including Booker and Aton, there is no room to play, hard power gap.

The biggest surprise for the clippers is Rondo. 19 minutes, 5 in 8, 3 in 4, 15 points, 3 rebounds, 9 assists, 24 points on the court! Rondo won Paul today. If Rondo maintains this level and condition, to be honest, if the Lakers and the Clippers meet in the playoffs, the chances are not good. The clippers have strengthened the last short board!
