Howard played 18 minutes and 39 seconds today, 1 in 0, got 9 points and 11 rebounds (4 front court). To be honest, no one in the Clippers team can limit Howard. Howard holds the ball under the basket. The clippers can only catch a foul to let Howard free throw. But Howard's own temper really needs to be restrained. In the last game against the Lakers, Howard played less than 6 minutes, attacking and defending Harrell, but because of continuous provocation, Harrell was expelled from the game, and this game was expelled. His personality problem has now become the biggest bottleneck limiting his development! After leaving the Lakers, he became a familiar prick.
