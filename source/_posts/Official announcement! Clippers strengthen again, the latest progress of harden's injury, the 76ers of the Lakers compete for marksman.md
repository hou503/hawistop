**The Lakers and the 76ers are interested in signing mcclemo**
According to mossy, the source revealed that both the Lakers and the 76ers are interested in mcclemo. In addition, many teams have expressed strong interest in mcclemo. So far this season, mcclemo has averaged 7.4 points + 2.1 rebounds per game, with a three-point shooting rate of 33.1%, not getting too many playing opportunities. But in the last season, mclermo hit 40% of the three-point ball, can average 2.6 three-point ball, is a very stable three-point shooter. The Lakers are eager to find an outfield player who can provide firepower output, and now the guard line of the Lakers is short of rotation, and the platoon is stretched. It's just that this time the Lakers are competing with the 76ers. Who can laugh to the end? In addition, pop said in an interview that thick eyebrow has started some personal shooting training. According to the previous reporter wenderhorst, Davis is expected to return in two weeks.

**The Clippers officially signed corhines! **
Although the clippers and cousins reached an early consensus, they have not signed a contract. After a long wait and various tests, the Clippers officially announced today that they will sign a 10 day contract with cousins, with a total salary of US $175000. At present, the only one in the League willing to give cousins a chance is the Clippers. After being bought out by the Rockets this season, koshins has not played for nearly 50 days, averaging 9.6 points, 7.6 rebounds and 2.4 assists. Interestingly, this is the fourth time that he and Rondo have become teammates. Before that, they have cooperated with kings, pelicans and the Lakers. Kaoxinsi's arrival can at least alleviate the pressure of the Clippers' interior. Ibaka has been absent for a long time, and it is difficult to rely on zubaz alone. I hope koshins can seize this opportunity.
