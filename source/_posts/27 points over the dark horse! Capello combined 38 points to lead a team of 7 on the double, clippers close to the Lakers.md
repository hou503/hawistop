The Clippers are not in good shape recently. They lost pelicans 20 points before, including the last complete defeat of the lone ranger. They have a lot of problems this season, the first of which is the lack of a point guard role. Lori, Rozier, hill and Bauer are all involved with the Clippers. There are still four days left before the closing date. The Clippers only have Rowe and Beverly in their hands, leaving them little time to strengthen. Statistics show that the number of times that the two teams have played together this season has reached 29, surpassing that of last season. The Clippers who played at the same time are 20-8, with a net efficiency of 15.3, but the efficiency is not high at the critical moment, which is also related to the increase of organizational tasks they undertake this season. Clippers want to fight against the Lakers, want to go further, just rely on George and Leonard to organize the attack is not enough.

At present, the overall situation in the western region is very complicated. After this game, the Clippers' record came to 27-16, 1.5 games behind the Lakers and Suns, and 1 game ahead of nuggets and blazers. James is absent indefinitely, and the Lakers are short of Jamie. I'm afraid it's difficult to keep the top three position. The Clippers are not optimistic now, nuggets and Pioneers work at the same time, the top six competition in the west is fierce, and now is the only chance for the Clippers to catch up with the Lakers.
