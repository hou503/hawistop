The craziness at the end of the trading window is Lori. After the 76ers and the Clippers quit the competition, only the Lakers and the heat are left to compete. In the words of the famous Hayes, the Raptors hope to use the Lakers to raise the heat's offer, but the heat remain unmoved and insist on not trading Hiro. On the side of the Lakers, they have packed Schroeder and Popper as backcourt partners, ready to send them to Florida (the Raptors' home court this season is Tampa, Florida). However, the Raptors and the Lakers failed to reach an agreement on a small detail, and finally Lori stayed in the Raptors. What little details?

According to the famous report by chalaniya, the Lakers are willing to take out Schroeder and Pope in order to get Lori, but they are not willing to give up Horton Tucker. What bad ideas can Raptors have? When Lori's contract expires this season, they just want to get some young players for reconstruction, and they don't want to make a clean break. In the management of the Lakers, Horton Tucker's status is higher than many players. Because of Horton Tucker, the Lakers missed Lori and the last chance to strengthen in the trading window. Some fans will say, is Lori really worth pop + Schroeder? If there is such an opportunity, the Lakers must change it. It is also the lack of two super giants. Why can the nets still play a triumphant song in the East while the Lakers lose four in a row? The way of breaking things into a whole, the Lakers have already experimented, Davis's trade is not to help the Lakers get the championship?

Although Lori is 35 years old, his performance in the past few seasons is very stable and efficient. This season, he averaged 17.4 points + 5.6 rebounds + 7.5 assists + 1.1 steals, with a three-point shooting rate of 39.5%. His ability to attack fouls is the top level in the league, and his counter position defense ability, including the ability to burst and kill + create projection space for the outside line, is also the top level in the League! Even though he is 35 years old, he can shine like Paul. Who would have thought he could lead the Suns to second place in the west this season? And the most important thing is that Lori is a leader. There are really few stars in the league who are worthy of the word "leader". When Leonard came to the Raptors, Lori was the first to stand up and lead his teammates: we should listen to Leonard, he is super giant! Otherwise, the small card can not manage the load so easily.

In fact, Tucker has been pulled out of the deal several times this season. Before that, the Rockets' PJ Tucker was making a fuss about leaving, and the Lakers were very interested in it, and the Rockets' request was to use Horton tucker to replace Tucker, but the Lakers rejected this proposal and changed it to Matthews + second round signing, and the Rockets directly refused. In addition, the pre-season performance of Tucker is very good. After those games, Vogel promised that Tucker will have a rotation position in the new season. Tucker has played 41 games for the Lakers this season, averaging 18.4 minutes. He can get 7.9 points + 2.7 rebounds + 2.3 assists, with a shooting percentage of 44.3% and a three-point shooting percentage of 24.7%. Jen said that if the draft, Tucker will never fall into the second round, but Jen did not say that if the draft, Tucker can enter the Lotto area.

From Vogel to Jen, they are trying to train tucker to play together with James and Davis. In addition, increasing the time he and Schroeder play double back, including increasing the pick and roll tactics of him and Harrell, is really a way to train players. But Tucker's performance is disappointing. Although the data is barely passable, his efficiency is low Including the contribution value of victory, they are lower in the middle of the league. He needs the right to the ball, he needs a certain degree of freedom, but in a team like the Lakers, which aims to win the championship, it is difficult to give him enough opportunities to exercise himself. The Lakers are reluctant to let go, saying they will try their best to keep Tucker in the summer.

I have to say that Tucker has done a lot of harm to old Jan and thick eyebrow. Jen will have to rest for 3-5 weeks, and Nongmei will not return until 2 weeks at the fastest. This also means that the Lakers may have to play about 14 games before Jen comes back. The worst prediction is that when Jen comes back, there will only be 7-8 games left. The current record of the Lakers is 28-17, ranking fourth in the western region, but it is only six games away from the 10th warriors in the western region. Without James, who can be the leader of the Lakers? No one can take on this responsibility, not Popper, not Schroeder, not Kuzma. If the Lakers lose until Jen returns, the season is over.

Of course, the Lakers won't miss the playoffs this season, but that's the problem. If the Lakers are still in eighth or ninth place at the end of the regular season, Jen and Davis may have to work ahead of time, which may increase their physical burden. The Lakers lost another 10 games in a row, and Jen came back early with injuries. So you should know why the Lakers are so eager to get Lori before the trading window. Lori is the kind of leader who can motivate his teammates, and he has stable scoring ability, can control the field and defend. The Lakers missed a leader when Jen was absent. Of course, it's the choice of the Lakers. If they lose all the time, James has to come back ahead of time. This season is really tough for the Lakers!
