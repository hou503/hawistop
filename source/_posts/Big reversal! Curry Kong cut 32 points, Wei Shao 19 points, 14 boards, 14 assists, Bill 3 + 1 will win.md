It's difficult for curry to find space for his shots. In the last six seconds of the game, Cole let green catch the ball and then passed it to Damian Lee. Damian Lee was not ready to attack the box and was directly cut off by afdiya, so the warriors lost the game. The positive and negative value of Curie - 16 is the lowest in the whole game.
