The net finally lost! In fact, in the past nearly a month, the nets have been trying to catch up with the 76ers, but the 76ers didn't give them a chance. Even in the absence of nbid, under the leadership of Harris and Simmons, they won all the games they should win. And the nets, now is the leadership to honor, the coaching staff to performance, that can only suffer the players. But Durant has been injured for a long time, and Owen does not dare to overuse it. Nash asks d'antony: Sir, what should we do? D'antony yawned, pointed to the light, and Nash said, "do you want me to go to bed early?" D'antony: we have harden And the magic game, harden 34 minutes 29 seconds, 15 in 4, got 19 points 4 rebounds 9 assists, poor performance.

Owen, 39 minutes, 31-19, 3-point-8-3, scored 43 points, 6 rebounds and 4 assists. After the first three quarters, he scored 36 points. As a result, in the fourth quarter, he only made six shots. In these six shots, some university asked: he only hit one goal in four layups. In other times, he was mainly attacked by funier and bacon, which did not give Owen an easy chance to play solo. When the fourth quarter of the nets to catch up with only four points, Joe ha two three points, Clarkston did not eat cake, the nets instant crash. In fact, in Nash's tactical system, he really takes Owen as the last choice. Owen only attacks when harden doesn't have the feeling. In the third quarter, the whole team is depressed, and Owen starts the attack mode. In fact, Owen lacks some opportunities for misplaced singles, and creates vacancies through shielding or conduction.

Statmuse statistics show that 101 players have made three-point shots at least 20 times after the weekend, while harden has made 5 of 36 shots in the five games, with a three-point shooting rate of only 13.9%, ranking the last in the League! Harden's performance is even stronger than that of ubre. In fact, harden always has such a low performance for a period of time every season. However, this season is totally different from the past. His physical fitness has been greatly overdrawn. In the match with magic, harden made mistakes and fouls from the second quarter, 1 in 8 in half, which is definitely not what we know about harden. But the net lost, can you simply blame harden's poor performance? In fact, it has nothing to do with harden. He and Owen are the victims of the team.

The nets didn't dare to let Griffin play, and Durant didn't return. They were also playing a psychological game with the Lakers and the 76ers. The 76ers are short of enbid, the Lakers are short of Davis, the nets are now Owen's rotation, only harden with the residual difficult points, really embarrassed. But it's also this kind of embarrassment that makes opponents relax. If Griffin plays well, the Lakers will continue to strengthen and the 76ers will continue to strengthen. If Durant comes back now, it will be difficult for other teams competing for the championship to keep their lineup full all over the world. After the trade deadline, Griffin will be able to play. Before the trade deadline, even if harden is a father and a mother, even if Owen cuts 40 +, it doesn't matter. The biggest short board of the nets is little Jordan.

Take playing magic as an example. In the first three quarters of little Jordan's presence, magic scored 103 points. In the fourth quarter, little Jordan was abandoned. In Clarkston Station No. 5, magic only scored 18 points. What's little Jordan's biggest problem? He has no idea on the defensive end! More than once this season, harden discussed the position with little Jordan on the court. The other team's center is facing a change of defense, which is one of two choices. Either he will jump out directly and limit the opponent's three-point shooting, or he will never go out and stick to the basket and expect his teammates to make up for him. And little Jordan his position is often not in the basket, and can't follow the opponent to the outside line, he often hesitated, leading to the inside and outside of the net. To put it bluntly, his sense of position is too bad. If you meet a big tall guy with an outside line, such as thick eyebrow or enbid, little Jordan, this point can be broken by counterpoint! Up to now, little Jordan's positive and negative value is only + 0.9, the nets are now nine rotation, just better than shamette.

According to the Cleveland honest man, it's hard for the Cavaliers to send Zhuang Shen away before the deadline of the deal. Now all the teams in the league are waiting for Zhuang Shen to buy out. Zhuang Shen gives up millions of salary. It's wise for the Cavaliers to spend less money to break up with him. Chuang Shen averaged 17.5 points and 13.5 rebounds this season. His rebounding rate is the top three in the league. If the nets get Chuang Shen with middle-class exception or injury exception, they can completely give up the use of little Jordan, let Durant, Harris and harden in the outside line change their defense, and let Chuang Shen guard the basket. Chuang Shen's ability of protecting frame and blocking position is the top in the league, and the substitute Clarkston also has enough Impact, including Griffin can also provide some help, which is the best choice for the nets.

And the biggest opponent of the nets is the Lakers. Now it's time for the nets to fight to the death with the Lakers. If the Lakers get Zhuangshen again and sit on the combination of James + Davis + Zhuangshen, if the two teams meet in the finals, the inside line of the nets will be vulnerable, and the double tower combination of Davis and Zhuangshen can really crush the inside line of the nets. There is no way out for the nets now. If they want to compete for the championship this season, they have to win Zhuang Shen. As for little Jordan, he can't be reused. If he can give away and get some fighting power, it may be the best outcome.
