NBA regular season has been going on for two-thirds, the strength is clear, each belongs to its position. The western region is in a mess this season. The jazz and Suns firmly hold the top two. But to be honest, it is difficult for the two teams with the best record in the League to come to the end. The Jazz League has the best record and the fourth best chance to win the league. The Suns are second in the league and eighth in the league in terms of winning probability. In the playoffs, the competition is about who can make fewer mistakes and whose core is stronger. In the west, the Lakers and the Clippers will always be the only one. Recently, the Clippers beat the Suns 113-103, which is really interesting. The mantis catches the cicada and the Yellow sparrow is behind. It turns out that the Clippers always keep their hand.

In the game with the Suns, the Clippers scored double, Leonard scored 27 points, 5 rebounds, 5 assists, normal level; George scored 33 points, 7 rebounds, 3 assists, with George's talent, this is his normal level; Rondo played 19 minutes, 5 in 8, 3 in 4, 15 points, 3 rebounds, 9 assists, a net win of 24 points, the highest in the game! Long, the winner, did not forget to ridicule my gun brother after the game: "the opponent's No. 3 called out their tactics. I know what that means. I passed it on to my teammates and saw through their tactics. Our coaching team has done a lot of work in investigating opponents and knows what to do at the critical moment. " After George's game, he said: "Jane (Rondo) shared the pressure of my organization. I can attack leisurely. This is the way I like."

Rondo has played only three games since joining the Clippers. Against the Lakers, Rondo played 13 minutes, 1 in 3, got 2 points and 3 assists; against the Blazers, Rondo played 15 minutes, 1 in 4, got 2 points and 2 rebounds; against the Suns, Rondo played 19 minutes, got 15 points, 3 rebounds and 9 assists. In these three games, Rondo's total positive and negative value was + 35, and the Clippers won three consecutive games. Rondo is that strong? Not even in the face of Paul? Compared with the Laker's lineup last season, the Clippers' lineup this season is really suitable for Rondo. There are seven people with a three-point shooting rate of more than 38%. In addition, the Clippers' attack players are the main ones, and they are good at picking and removing the forward, air cutting, and low pass and cut. There are zubaz in the interior and Ibaka in the truce. Not counting kaohsins, Rondo just needs to throw the ball Attack.

Take the game against the Suns for example. From the end of the first period to the beginning of the second period, Rondo played together with Patterson, Reggie, Batum and George. He made a wonderful counter attack and George shot three points. In positional warfare, he and Patterson gave Batum an assist and led the team to stop the suns. At the beginning of the third quarter, Rondo feeds xiaoka cakes and fastens, and gives zubaz high hanging cakes, including to the decisive moment of the fourth quarter, when Beverly is expelled, Rondo comes up, and the clipper will live soon. George and Rondo take away the sun with three minutes of rain! There is a Beverly upset the mentality of the opponent in the first round, even if he is sent off as cannon fodder, upset the mentality of the opponent, and replace Rondo to revitalize the whole team! In the Clippers system, the only opponent who dares to play is Rondo, so Rondo can score 3-in-4 with his own three-point goal! Is there a better defender than Rondo for the Clippers? Yes, that's Paul.

In the last two games, Carlos scored 29 points against the Blazers, 27 points against the suns and 56 points in two games; George scored 36 points against the Blazers, 33 points against the suns and 69 points in two games. These are all changes after Rondo's arrival. George hit 30 + in two consecutive games and scored at least six three-point goals, the first in clippers history! With Rondo in, George doesn't need to attack in series at all. In fact, for most of the season, Cary and George have no choice but to organize attacks. After all, the Clippers don't have a master, but they don't want to do this kind of work if they have a reliable guard. Isn't it good for Carlos to make a series of buckles on the heads of Aton and Claude? Is it uncomfortable for George to concentrate on 3D and easily throw 30 + points in a game? Rondo's arrival has solved the problem that plagued the Clippers for two seasons!

To be honest, from the perspective of the Lakers, if the clippers have Rondo's level of ball controller, it's a great test for the Lakers, even a disaster! Rondo is very familiar with the Lakers, including the specific playing methods of Jen and Davis, and the tactical layout requirements of Vogel. And the performance of the Lakers Schroeder is like that. If when the Lakers and the Clippers meet, the Clippers put forward a lineup of Rondo + George + Leonard + little Morris + Ibaka, with one point guard and four powerful attack lines, how should the Lakers deal with it? With Rondo, I feel that the Clippers are more stable and have their own helmsman. In Rondo's words, he is here to help Cary and George. What about the Lakers? Don't look forward to the peak match between the Lakers and the nets. The west is losing suspense.
