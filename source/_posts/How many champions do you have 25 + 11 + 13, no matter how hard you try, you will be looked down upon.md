Most of the players who enter the NBA naturally take the championship as their ultimate goal, but there is only one winner in a League of 30 teams every year. It's too hard to get to the end! In a recent game, the wizard lost 87-109 to the lone ranger, and bill was absent. Bachun was also injured and absent. Wei Shao led the team alone for four consecutive games. The wizard never said when bill would return, nor did he say how Bachun's injury was. He only knew that the wizard had these dishes, and only one Wei Shao led the team. It didn't matter whether he won or lost! How many champions do you have? Yes, no matter how hard Wei Shao tries, it's too hard for him to lead the team to win.

Celebrity Stephen a Smith said: "weishao is a real man. He breaks all kinds of data records every day. This is his routine operation. He is an MVP. He has entered the division finals four times, but he has not won the championship. He is also a teammate with Durant, George, harden and other players. When I evaluate other players, whether it's James or curry, we will look at the number of champions. Has Willis ever won the championship In the past March, weishao averaged 25.2 points + 10.9 rebounds + 12.5 assists, 25 + 11 + 13 data, of which assists per game were higher than harden! To tell you the truth, Wei Shao's assists are much more valuable than harden's. only beltans's three-point hit rate is more than 38% in the whole prodigy. How many times does Wei Shao have to break through and to whom can he brush out an assist?

Since March 30, bill has been absent from the Pacers game because of his injury. In the game with the Pacers, Wei Shao played 39 minutes, 26 in 14, 3-point ball 6 in 4, with a total of 35 points, 14 rebounds, 21 assists and 2 steals. He is the first player in NBA history to play 35 + 10 + 20. In order to win the next game, Wei Shao, almost 33 years old, has 26 shots in a single game, 21 assists and 14 baskets Cricket, can you say he doesn't want to win? After playing the Hornets, Wei Shao got 22 points, 15 rebounds and 14 assists. Indeed, Wei Shao didn't feel good in this game, so he kept rushing for rebounds and feeding cakes to his teammates. As a result, his teammates' empty shot hit rate was not as good as his own. In the game with the pistons, he lost 29 points to his opponent, but his team-mates still made 7 of 16, got 16 points, 11 rebounds and 12 assists?

Bill didn't come back. Bamura was injured. Thomas Bryant was reimbursed for the season. The best teammate around weishao was bertans, who averaged 10.8 points per game, followed by little Lopez, netto and Ryan. To be honest, the current team-up of the wizard is worse than the Rockets. There are at least wood and haustete around wall Some tough guys, and little Porter and little Martin have shown certain talents. The Rockets' lineup is a grade better than the Wizards in terms of ability alone. The Wizards' lineup was originally thin. If it wasn't for Wei Shao's big deal, they would have been determined to be rotten, and they would have been used to the way a small team should survive: simply living, only seeking to be rotten.

O'Neill also talked about Wei Shao: "after becoming a great player, when you play a burst of data, people will only stir up the flames and say," do you have a champion? " That's what's unfortunate about the industry right now. " Yes, weishao hasn't won the championship in his career up to now. He's not even as lucky as Makao or McKee. To put it mildly, he's not as lucky as Sun Yue. But weishao is weishao after all! How did he lead thunder forward four or five years ago? Now is how to lead the wizard forward. He has long been used to taking all responsibilities. He has long been used to the depression of his teammates. He has long been used to going alone. It's true that his team-mates are not as good as each other. Wei Shao often has to work hard to win the next game. But can you say that Wei Shao is not as good as McCoy or McKee?

Different from harden Durant, when the thunder sent harden away, he built fewer teams around durantway. Later, Durant left when he was blocked out of the finals in succession. Later, George joined and left again. Dewey stuck to one person, one city for ten years. At that time, he might have put the championship aside. Maybe he knew that his playing method was not suitable for the championship, but he was a champion Straight did not give up efforts! Wei Shao is not a God. He can't turn the tide in every game. He just needs to be good at himself, because the championship is not the only standard to measure the greatness of players. After a few years, who can be like Wei Shao, who can deduce the three pairs of data and persistence to the extreme?
