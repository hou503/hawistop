When mclarm didn't come back, the Blazers had a chance to attack the top four in the West. When mclarm returned, the Blazers couldn't keep the sixth place. It's not for mclarm, but for the Blazers, which seems to have a lot of weaknesses. The team has two centers in the interior, nuerjic and Kanter, but they basically don't get much effective support. Most of the time, the two guns are floating on the outside to shoot three points, including the new arrival of Powell, who also likes to throw three points on the outside. Anthony's low single tactics become the team's antidote, but such pioneers, it is difficult to break the first round in the playoffs, they are now lack of scoring inside, Anthony tried his best! Lillard made 5 of 13 three-point goals in this game. With these 5 three-point goals, he hit 1988 three-point goals in his career, tied with Kidd and tied for the tenth in history!
