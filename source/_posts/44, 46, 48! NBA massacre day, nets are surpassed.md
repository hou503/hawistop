The 7-10 gap is relatively large. Now the warriors are not optimistic. Although the kings and pelicans are losing in a row, they are narrowing the gap. Now there are still some suspense about the position of the last number one in the West. The Rockets are 2 games ahead of the Timberwolves, and they are the champion.
