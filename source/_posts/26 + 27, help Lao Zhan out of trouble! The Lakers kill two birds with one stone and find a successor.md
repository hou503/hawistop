The Lakers have bad news. According to Hayes, Davis is highly likely to miss the next three weeks or more. The Lakers have confirmed Davis will wait two weeks to reassess his tendinitis and calf strain. The Lakers are very cautious about Davis' return, even if the ranking goes down. Davis has been absent for a month since February 15, when the Lakers won 5-7. In the last two games, they beat the Pacers 105-100 and the warriors 128-97. One thing is for sure, the Lakers are slowly getting rid of Davis dependency. Among them, Harrell's play is crucial!

In the game before the all star game, the Lakers lost 120-123 to kings. Harrell played 33 minutes, 13 in 22, and got 26 points and 12 rebounds (7 front court). In fact, both Harrell and Kuzma performed very well in that game. The Lakers almost won the opponent. Even without James, the young players' attitude of daring to play and fight, including some details of handling the ball, is improving . Kuzma made a great contribution in beating the Pacers in the last game, but Harrell sent 17 points and 6 rebounds in 8 of 11. In the recent game against warriors, Harrell scored 19 points in the half, 11 out of 14 scored 27 points, 5 rebounds and 3 steals. In Su Qun's words, Wiseman was weak in front of Harrell.

But during this period, Harrell experienced the biggest change in his life. On March 11, Janie bass, the female owner of the Lakers, suddenly tweeted: "we love you, monterez (Harrell), and give you a hug on behalf of the whole team. We are always by your side." Before the all star weekend, Harrell is very happy to say that he wants to make good use of this weekend to have a rest. He has worked out his daily plan. Just after the all star weekend, the day before the start of the second half of the NBA season, Harrell's mother died, which made it into the National hot search. In the words of people familiar with the Lakers, Harrell's mood is extremely unstable and his mentality is very poor. Whether he can return to the team is questionable.

But just one day later, Harrell showed his boarding photo on the social platform. He had been on the plane from Atlanta to Los Angeles (delta dl335). Harrell wrote: "the adjustment of life." After arriving in Los Angeles, Harrell revealed a life experience: "many things in life may come back to you, but time never will." I suddenly thought of Bradley. Harrell didn't miss every game of the Lakers, but because of the nature of his work, he didn't stay with his family all the time. Even if his mother died, he would return to the Lakers. Life is always greater than basketball, and Harrell turns grief into strength, breaking out in the game, which is absolutely worth affirming!

According to statistics, Harrell became the first Laker substitute who scored 25 + and hit more than 75% in a single game after zubartz in January of 19. But Harrell's contribution to the game is much higher than zubaz's. Harrell is not tall. The official height is only 2.03 meters, even shorter than James. He basically faces people who are more than 2.1 meters long, such as Wiseman and Holmes. He must have made more efforts than others to get more opportunities and get 20 + points, doesn't he? In fact, in the absence of Davis, it was because of the excellent performance of Harrell and Kuzma that the Lakers came out of the haze of four consecutive losses. It's really difficult to rely on James alone!

The Lakers made a double! On the second day after the free market opened last year, after Howard announced that he had joined the 76ers, everyone thought that the inside of the Lakers suddenly lost their fighting power. Harrell signed a two-year $19 million contract with the Lakers. The contract was really not high for Harrell, but Harrell was very happy. At that time, in an interview, he also said that his family was very happy when he chose the Lakers Cheng gave a lot of support. Yes, because it's the closest to the championship, because there are James and Davis. Harrell's role is in the Clippers period. The impact of the fifth position is very strong. The Lakers need him to score. The clippers, in vain, lost a field average of 19 points in the interior. The reason why the Clippers are struggling this season is that they are not good at attacking and defending from the inside.

As the trade deadline is getting closer and closer, many media advise the Lakers that they should compete for the stars of oradibo and Derozan, and Harrell is the best chip. But James is right: "we need Trez's energy and effort, he still knows us, he played too many games in the Clippers before, he is getting better every game, we can't lose him." Harrell can't go. His role in the Laker team now is the thick eyebrow on the Laker bench. He can attack the frame with the ball, make high-quality pick and roll for Jen, and eat cakes efficiently. The average annual income is less than 10 million. The Laker really can't do without him!
