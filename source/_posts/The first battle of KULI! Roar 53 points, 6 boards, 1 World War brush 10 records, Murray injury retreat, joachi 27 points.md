The most worrying thing in this game is Murray. He missed four games in a row because of sore right knee before. Today, in the fourth quarter, Murray hit back to lay up and fell out of the baseline. He covered his left knee after falling to the ground. His expression was very painful. Either there was a problem with cruciate ligament or hamstring injury. Murray refused to leave in a wheelchair and was helped out. I hope he's OK. Nuggets can't do without him in the playoffs.
