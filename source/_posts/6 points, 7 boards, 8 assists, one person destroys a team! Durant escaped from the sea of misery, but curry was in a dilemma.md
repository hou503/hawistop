Last season, the warriors won only 15 games. When they became the vice squad leader of the western region, they won the top spot. Other teams are looking for a deal, but the warriors are not willing to give up. It's understandable that it's not easy to make a bad show. The reward must not be given to others easily. The warriors of this season have had a bumpy start. When green is away, people see and deceive him. Green came back and once rushed to the sixth place in the western region. He fell down again after fighting. Curry's injury problem and Cole's personnel problem, 23-26, made the western region lose the tenth place, and the playoff qualification is almost lost. In a recent game, the warriors 77-130 Raptors lost 53 points. Who else dares to say that they are warriors fans?

The net loss of 53 points is the biggest single game loss difference of warriors in recent 49 years and the biggest single game loss difference of this season. Yes, curry and green can't play, there is foreshadowing, but the Raptors also let a Lori, van fritt also only played more than ten minutes to leave injured, raptors team salary is not as high as the warrior's luxury tax! In the last two minutes of the third quarter, when colla signaled NASS to spare himself and change players quickly, it can prove that colla, the champion coach, really has moisture. The struggling performance of the warriors this season, in fact, has long been foreshadowed in the peak period. It's Cole's fault and Curry's fault. Of course, it all points to one person: Drummond green.

In this back-to-back game, curry was absent due to pain in the caudal vertebrae. Half an hour before the game, the warriors gave green the starting position, but at the beginning of the game, Green's starting position was changed to Anderson. After that, reporter Andrews followed up, and green was absent due to finger and hip injuries. Yes, maybe in Cole's mind, he has already made a plan to lose, otherwise he would not let Wiseman play indiscriminately, let ubre use inefficient breakthrough to carry out singles tactics, and let Wiggins follow his teammates. Grizzlies, curry absent, Wiggins shot 40 points to lead the team to win. Although the warriors lost the game against the Hawks, Wiggins scored 29 points in 19 with 10 high efficiency. Cole really wanted to win. Why not let Wiggins play solo? Why don't you let green pick and roll Wiggins? No, Cole doesn't dare to do that. In fact, curry and green are the privileged doubles.

There is no need to mention the role and value of curry. Green averaged 6.3 points + 6.5 rebounds + 8.4 assists this season, which is close to shunzi's data of 6 points, 7 rebounds and 8 assists. His three-point shooting rate is 26.8%. Because of his low-level mistakes this season, the warriors lost to the Spurs and the Hornets. When he lost to the Spurs, green made a super long three-point shot and lost to the Hornets. At the last moment, he continuously asked the referee to be expelled and the Hornets completed the reversal. Yes, green has been a professional dealer of warriors since four years ago. At that time, there were water brothers who constantly cut to create three-point shooting opportunities, including igordala Livingston and others. Later, there was Durant. Green didn't have to pay attention to his shooting and scoring at all. But now, because he can't score, his opponents don't care about him at all, they just need to stare at him Just stay in the library!

Because Wiggins has no tactical position, because ubre has no three-point shooting ability, and there is still Wiseman who has been sleepwalking in it. Why has curry been pinched all the time, but his teammates still have no chance to shoot? Here's the answer! Is Cole willing to give up Green's successful passing and cutting tactics? Not willing, that helped him to get three championships, in fact, the most important point is that the warriors and green signed a four-year $100 million contract, Cole can't do without it! Even if we trade green away, what can we get in return? At the beginning, Green said that before Durant came, we were the championship. We forced him away by some means. When he got a hundred million yuan contract in the off-season, Cole and curry were really happy, because although Durant left, the warriors' own system was still there. By Green's side, curry is still the super giant who can get 30 +.

But in fact, from the moment Durant joined the warriors, the system of green and the warriors was in vain, because in the last two championships, Durant came forward at the critical moment, not you, green, not curry, who was at a disadvantage in height and strength. The luxury tax of the warriors this season is higher than the salary of 25 teams in the league. When the warriors trade Wiggins and ubre, they must also want to go according to the template of Durant and clay to restore the Hampton system. But when they are forced to wear masks, Wiggins will lose his light and ubre will have no value at all.

Cole is not to blame, and he is unlikely to break his own frame and give up green completely. Curry can't let the warriors send green away, so no one will pass to him, no one will play the core of the warriors' passing. However, the warriors' tragic defeat can not be blamed on the players like Wiggins, ubre and Wiseman. You need to have a good record, you need to have a familiar tactical system, but rookies need to practice in the game. Wiggins and ubre also have their own familiar ways of playing. In the final analysis, green, it's a pity to eat tasteless and give up. Durant has escaped from the bitter sea. What should curry do? Kuri was in a real dilemma. The system was built around him, but now it's coming to an end. Otherwise, at the end of his career, he will form a group of old Jen to fight against Durant's net?
