This season, Owen and Durant dominate in the East. The third younger brother harden came to lead the nets to pass all the way. After Griffin asked to join, Adelaide bought out and joined. In the past few years, these people are the core number one of their respective teams. Today, there is only one goal in the nets: Championship! After this wave of three consecutive wins, the net finally rose to the first in the East! Five games on the scene 62 points, nets and a giant showdown! Sorry Durant, you should have a good rest first!

It's not Owen! To be honest, I was skeptical of Griffin joining the nets at the beginning. The reason is very simple. I simply feel that Griffin is difficult to play the role he should play when his physical condition is obviously declining. In the period of the pistons, they averaged 12.3 points, 5.2 rebounds, 3.9 assists, 36.5% of the shooting percentage, and 31.5% of the three-point shooting percentage. This kind of efficiency is already at the lower level of the league. Moreover, they have not dunked the basketball for one year in the pistons, so their bodies are obviously unable to bear the pressure of the game, and they can only float outside. When it comes to the net, Griffin has played five games, averaging 19 minutes per game, and can get 8.6 points + 4.4 rebounds + 2.2 assists + 1 steals. What's the level? If measured according to the standard 36 minutes, Griffin can contribute 16.3 points + 8.3 rebounds + 4.1 assists + 1.9 steals per game, very fierce!

Take the rocket game as an example. Griffin played 22 minutes, 4 of 5 shots, 2 of 3 points, 4 rebounds, 4 assists, 2 steals, 1 block, 23 points, the highest in the team! At the end of the third quarter, Jeff Green breaks through the layup box. Griffin is ready to take off one step ahead of Green's shot. When Tate and wood are still observing whether the ball can be scored, Griffin has already taken off and is directly pressed by Griffin after the ball pops up! In the last five minutes of the fourth quarter, the net only led by one point. Clarkston didn't have a good chance to pass the ball. Griffin didn't hesitate at the top of the left arc. He made a three-point shot and entered the net! In the last 100 seconds of the fourth quarter, Harris and Griffin hand-in-hand cooperate and pass it to Owen. Owen is pinched and returns to Griffin. Griffin's top of the arc blows another three points, directly killing the suspense of the game!

In the game with the wizard, Griffin played for 15 minutes, winning 12 points, the highest in the team! In the game with the Blazers, Griffin played for 19 minutes, got 8 points, 5 rebounds, 2 steals, won 9 points, the second highest in the team, second only to Harris! Against the pistons, Griffin played 20 minutes, got 17 points, won 5 points, only followed by ruwau and Johnson, the team's third highest! And the Timberwolves game, Griffin played 19 minutes, got 5 points, 6 rebounds, 5 assists, 13 points, the highest team! And the Rockets game, Griffin played 22 minutes, got 11 points, 6 rebounds, 4 assists, 23 points, the highest team! Five games, a total of 62 points, the nets team is far ahead of other teammates, once or twice may not be able to explain the problem, but every time he wins a net, then he is a great hero!

People with dreams will really work hard! In the piston period, Griffin would not grab the ball that opened five or five times, nor would he go to play cricket, nor would he chase his own defenders in the rotation defense, because that was the piston, because everyone was used to playing around, and Griffin also became lazy and slack in such an environment. When he came to the net, Nash also put him on the bench to watch the game for a week. When he came out of the game, Griffin was too active. He flew to grab the cricket, and actively picked and rolled for harden and Owen, including the extremely unstable middle distance before, Griffin made great progress! After coming to the net, Griffin's shooting percentage is 65.2%, and the three-point shooting percentage is 55.6%, which is terrible! And Griffin net efficiency value as high as + 34, is also ranked first in the League!

"Over the past two years, you've all said how bad I was, but when I picked the net, everyone was saying, 'it's not fair to other teams.' I'm still me. I just want to continue to prove myself. I know my teammates and I still have a lot of work to do. We have to get better. The current squad doesn't guarantee to win the championship. We have to do our best! " Speaking and doing, Griffin's performance will really improve the impression of a large number of fans on him! The selection of the nets was a great success! Little Jordan? It's only a matter of time before you fall out of rotation. As for Durant, you can fight with the fans on the social platform. Now there are a lot of players available in the fourth and fifth positions of the net, and there are also Johar and brown in the third position. It's not too late for you to come back from the playoffs.
