The competition in the west is fierce this season. The rankings of the Lakers and Clippers are relatively general. The Lakers, in particular, are plagued by injuries. Davis' long truce and James' high ankle sprain have cast a shadow over the regular season of this season. For the Lakers, in the absence of Davis and Jens, to be able to stabilize the top six is their only goal, don't expect to reverse the impact of the top three. Since Jen was injured in the game against the Hawks, the Lakers have played 10 games without Jen Mei, with a record of 4-6, which is far more than the outside world expected. But it also proves that sometimes they will never know their potential without forcing them.

In a recent game, the Lakers won 110-101 over the Raptors, and the final score was almost the same, but the game was completely one-sided. Both lack two cores (the Lakers lack Jamie, the Raptors lack Lori and van fritt), but the Lakers were 34 points ahead! The 7-man double and 18 three-point shootings in the game are a great comfort to the fans. And the most enjoyable thing is not the performance of the Laker players on the field, but the off-site old Jen. Jen follows the team to Florida (the Raptors' home is temporarily moved to Tampa this season) and cheers for his teammates on the sidelines! Come in with a bag of money, just when Harrell is expelled, will old Zhan pay for Harrell?

During the competition, the famous sports physiotherapist, Dr. rajabral, gave a detailed explanation of Lao Zhan's recovery from injury, because it was the first time that Lao Zhan took off his protective boots after injury and appeared in public. During the match, Jen walked around the court frequently without any sign of injury. Brad analysis: "LeBron recovery speed is too fast, he does not need to use protective boots, LeBron needs to carry out weight-bearing training in the next stage, the Lakers need to gradually increase the training intensity according to his body feedback." From the eagles injury on March 23, to now, in the past 16 days, Lao Zhan took off his protective boots. In fact, according to the original estimate, Lao Zhan's injury is conservatively estimated to be a truce for 4-6 weeks. In other words, it's good that he can come back before May! I didn't expect that old Zhan could walk freely now. And the arrival of old Zhan, will bring spiritual inspiration to the team-mates, during the game, old Zhan many times to Tucker and Caruso face-to-face advice.

Congratulations to the Lakers, congratulations to Jen, your goal has been achieved! In fact, when Davis and Jen are injured, the prospects of the Lakers are bleak. At that time, according to the analysis of "Lake show life" reporter Reid, it is very good that the winning rate of the Lakers can reach 30% without the two giants. The Lakers lost four games in a row in the first four games (losing to the Hawks, Suns, pelicans and 76ers in a row, and the overall strength of the opponent is really strong). After that, they won four games in six games, including defeating the Cavaliers, magic, kings and raptors. The two games they lost were bucks and Clippers. Even if the Laker holds the 40% probability and persists until Davis returns, the biggest opponent of the Laker now is not the sixth pioneer, but the seventh lone ranger. The Laker is three wins ahead of the lone ranger. As long as the Laker is guaranteed not to be overtaken by the lone ranger, the Laker will not have to play the playoff.

In each of the four games won, the Lakers have role players coming forward. Playing Cavaliers, Harrell 24 points, Schroeder 17 points; playing magic, Schroeder 24 points, Kuzma 21 points, Harrell 18 points; playing kings, Kuzma 30 points, Schroeder 17 points; playing raptors, the team's 7-man double, Tucker guest point guard company to send subtle assists, the field's old Zhan clapped! That's what the Lakers and Jens want their teammates to show. They need to overcome difficulties. In every game, someone has to come forward to play the core role of the team and lead the team forward. Second, unity! Schroeder was bullied by anunobi. As a daughter-in-law who came to the Laker with Schroeder, Harrell naturally couldn't see it and stood for Schroeder. In Schroeder's words, it's great because we're a family!

The third and most important point is the spirit of sacrifice. When Zhuang Shen came to the team, little Gasol was very angry. He was angry that his starting line-up was gone, and he might even fall out of rotation. In recent games, Zhuang Shen was injured, and Gasol performed very well. He protected the frame under the basket, connected in high position, including the top man blocking, and had a stable three-point projection. Gasol was willing to compromise, saying that he would do his best as long as he came on the field, no complaints, no matter whether he started or came off the bench! That's what the Lakers need. Didn't Howard and McKee sit on the bench for a long time in the playoffs last season? Including the finals, isn't Davis also volunteering to defend Butler? The spirit of sacrifice is the precondition for the team to go further, including Jen's sacrifice of the ball right to help Schroeder. And now the Lakers, more and more united, that's progress. When Jamie comes back, I hope the Lakers will be fresh and fresh and try their best to win the championship. I'm looking forward to seeing Jamie and Durant meet again in the finals!
