Zhuang Shen was unable to play in this game, while the magic, in the window period, sent off the four main players of the team, aimed at lousy. In the second quarter, when the Lakers were 13 points ahead of their opponents, they had no feeling at all in the second half, but Kuzma stepped out at the critical moment of the fourth quarter and led the team to play a 10-0 climax to turn the situation around! 96-93, the Lakers narrowly beat the magic at home, after the game, the Lakers are still 1.5 games ahead of nuggets and blazers.

At the beginning of the first quarter, Gasol and Maurice didn't touch the box in three points, while the magic relied on birch and bacon to get four points. After that, Kuzma scored two three-point goals and led the team to an 8-0 climax. The magic blossomed a lot. Schroeder scored four points in a row and OKiKi scored two three-point goals. At the end of the festival, Harrell kept on attacking and killing. The magic relied on young players Randall and porter to respond. In the first quarter, the Lakers had a 22-21 magic.

Finally, I can see the real level of this Laker. In fact, when James leads the team alone, it's really not easy for the Lakers to hold the second place in the West. In the absence of James, Schroeder can't control the whole team. On the contrary, Kuzma's performance is relatively stable, but today's feeling is not good. In addition to Kuzma, Harrell and Schroeder, the Lakers now have no stable scoring points, which is the biggest problem. Since James was injured, the offensive efficiency and 100 round net score of the Lakers are the last five in the league. Zhuang Shen's joining is like rain in time, which can protect rebounds and provide stable 15 + 15 output per game. I believe the Lakers are at least much better than now.

The next game for the Lakers is very, very difficult. The next game is against bucks, and then there is a wave of road trip, which is against kings, clippers, raptors, heat, nets, Knicks, Hornets in a row. In addition to kings, the others are not soft persimmons. Gloria, Jen's mother, revealed that Jen may be out of action for four weeks. If the Lakers want to keep the top six position in the west, they should not only keep the role players in their current state, but also hope Davis will return as soon as possible. Once it falls out of the sixth place and starts from the playoff, it will be more passive.
