Since harden came to the team, he led the team to play 26-8 (not counting the games that harden was absent), and the nets have soared from the Middle East to the first position in the east at the beginning of the season. Now that harden is injured, his mission has been successfully completed. According to Nash, harden is actively recovering. According to American media reports, the safest way is to let harden rest for about two weeks to ensure a complete recovery from his hamstring injury. Under the leadership of harden, the role players of the nets have improved significantly, but there is also an example, harden and Owen can not take you! Nash still gave a lot of time, you should say goodbye to the nets.

After joining the nets, harden averaged 25.2 points + 8 rebounds + 10.9 assists + 1.2 steals. From the beginning of coming to the nets, harden laid the tone for his role. In the first two games of harden + Owen + Durant, the nets lost to the Cavaliers in a row. In those two games, harden made 6 of 14 in each game. Even if there was a vacancy, he would not easily make a move, but tried to find it teammate. With the doubts of fans and media, harden proved his unique leading mode with his actions. When Owen is present, harden will attack in series. When Owen is not present, harden will lead his teammates. Unless his teammates are really unable to open up the situation, harden will open up his own firepower. And harden alone led the team to complete the 24 point reversal, defeated the Suns, completely conquered Owen! After that, Owen began to learn from harden to lead the team and connect the team attack, while harden Owen was present at the same time, 20-5 in the net!

Harden and Owen did their best, but there was one player who couldn't move! Timothy ruwau cabaro, who said he was a youngster, was somewhat reluctant. After all, he was 26 years old. He was selected by the 76ers in the first round in 16 years, and his career has changed from 76ers, thunder, bulls, Cavaliers and nets. Last February, the nets signed a multi-year contract with cabaro. Last season, cabaro averaged 18 minutes per game, with 7.8 points + 2.7 rebounds and a 3-point shooting rate of 38.8%. This season, when harden arrived and Owen returned, cabaro's data dropped sharply! Average 19.4 minutes, can get 6.6 points + 2.4 rebounds, three-point hit rate dropped to 32%!

In the previous game with the jazz, harden Owen was suspended at the same time. Cabaro, as the team's No. 3 starter, got 17 shots, the highest in the team, but 17 shots only hit 5 goals, including 2 of 9 three-point shots, 14 points and 5 rebounds, and 4 mistakes. Boyang, his counterpart, easily scored 18 points in 5 of 8. In a recent game, the net played pelican, and the game lost suspense early. Nash gave cabaro enough time to show himself. Cabaro played 26 minutes, all three-point shots, 2 in 13, second in the team after Owen, but only got 6 points, ranking ninth in the team! Although after the game from head coach Nash to Owen are encouraging him, said he will get back to touch, but his poor performance this season, really some sorry nets rotation lineup identity.

Sorry, I don't have much time left for you! There are too many injuries in the nets this season. Before that, Ding Weidi and Durant, including Owen, played and stopped, and green also had a rest for a period of time. Now, salmete, Johnson and harden are also injured. Sometimes the nets have to give cabaro some time, but his performance is disappointing. When salmete, Johnson and harden return, they will be on the rotation list of the nets in the playoffs It's hard to have a place for him. If even harden and Owen can't bring this kind of projection based player, where is his future?
