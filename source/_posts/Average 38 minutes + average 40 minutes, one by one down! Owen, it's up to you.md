Due to the epidemic situation, the NBA regular season this season has shrunk to 72 games, but the schedule density has increased greatly. In the past, three games a week or six games two weeks have been the limit. This season, three games five days, five games eight days have become a common practice. The intensive race schedule and the back and forth flight fatigue inevitably lead to injuries. In fact, this season, the teams also reduced the players' playing time. So far, there are only three players in the league who have exceeded 36 minutes per game: harden 31.7 minutes per game, Randall 37 minutes per game and van fritt 36.4 minutes per game. Interestingly, Owen's name also appears in the top ten of the list.

On February 14, the Nets beat the warriors. The nets won the game easily. They beat the warriors 134-117. Durant played 33 minutes, 8 in 19, 1 in 6, 20 points, 5 rebounds, 6 assists, and 4 mistakes. In fact, in the four games before that game, Durant was in the isolation stage, just came back, obviously not in a very good state, but surprisingly, he was injured after playing a game? After that, basketball net team reporter PASIO also revealed that, in fact, from the beginning of February, Durant has shown calf discomfort, but the basketball net team medical examination is no problem, Durant himself did not take it seriously. But after the warriors check found that Durant with tendinitis is still relatively serious, the rest time given at that time is a few games, all star weekend can catch up, but this time the injury truce for 50 days.

Here we need to talk about Durant's performance this season. He has played 19 games on behalf of the nets, averaging 35.7 minutes per game, scoring 29 points + 7.3 rebounds + 5.3 assists + 1.4 blocks, shooting percentage + three-point shooting percentage, including victory contribution value, which is comparable to Durant's MVP season. Durant is still that Durant. In January, when Durant was not injured, he played 11 games, averaging 38.3 minutes per game, including the Cavaliers' hard double overtime, in which Durant played 50 minutes! In the days when Owen disappeared suddenly, Durant's average playing time of more than 37 minutes has become the basic condition. At that time, there was also a dispute about Durant's playing time for too long, but there was no way. Owen disappeared and his rebounding performance was relatively general. Nash could only use Durant tightly.

With Durant, let's talk about harden. In the game with the Knicks, harden retired after more than four minutes. After the game, Nash said that after inspection, harden had no big problem, but for the sake of insurance, he still had to limit harden's playing time in the future, and did not give a specific comeback schedule. A few days ago, in the game with the Rockets, harden played 27 minutes, 5 out of 10, got 17 points and then retired. In fact, his hamstring injury was a bad signal. But Nash said that there was no big problem. He had a two game truce and played back-to-back against the Knicks. After four minutes, he couldn't hold on. Is this like Durant's 18 year finals? Yes, there is no problem in the pre game test and strength test of the team doctors of the nets. When it comes to the game, something is wrong. This is fatigue, but it does not affect the explosive power. There is only one reason: overuse.

In the past March, harden averaged 40.1 minutes per game, averaged 27.9 points, 9.8 rebounds and 11.5 assists per game, and won the best of the month in eastern China for two consecutive months. That's right. In the past two months, Durant was absent for a long time. Owen basically took a back-to-back rotation. In the middle, he invited his girlfriend for three vacations to give birth with him. Only harden kept on rotating. That's right. In the period of the Rockets, harden often played for 38-40 minutes, but in harden of the Rockets, he didn't participate in defense and came to the nets. He was another big player besides attacking and connecting The task is to defend from the low position, to top the power forward, to break through two rounds in one round. Did the Nets coach think of harden at that time?

One by one! From Durant to harden, it is the accumulation of high load density that leads to the failure of hamstring support. Nash and d'antony have not yet awakened? Maybe they already understand that they can't use super giant like this, maybe they also have mission goals in the regular season, such as locking in the first place in the East. But one thing is not good. In those games played by harden, Owen and Durant, all three of them went out for more than 36 minutes at the same time. This is not the right way for a qualified head coach to use giants. Now there is only one Owen left. Durant has a time limit even if he returns. I don't know how long Owen can hold on. Maybe this is also the biggest short board of the nets team, coach Nash also needs to fall a few more somersaults to know where there is a hole.
