Nash said in an interview before the game that harden hopes to play with injury this time, but the coaching staff refused, saying that they hope harden can learn to protect himself and come back against the pistons in the next game. It's rare for harden to have a rest. He also prepared snacks early to watch the game. Lack of Ding Weidi + Durant + Owen + harden + Griffin + salmete + Joha, the net is not the opponent of the jazz, the first quarter of the team only one assists, played to the third quarter points difference to 38 points! This game is of little significance for the nets. To give up strategically, we must give harden a rest. This loss, on the contrary, makes the nets unload their burden. Compared with winning, health is more important.

New recruit azley Johnson can be called the biggest surprise of the nets in this game. He grabs the rebounds in the front court, makes up the basketball with violence, including turning back and attacking hard. He has good footwork flexibility. If you give him some time, he is expected to become a member of the rotation lineup of the nets! Johnson also set a new record. He became the first player who could cut 15 + 15 in the first game in the recent 40 years! With the closing day of the trade approaching, more and more players are connected with the nets. Zhuang Shen is likely to be bought out, the next is the Lakers or the nets. Reddick may be bought out, the next family may be jazz or nets, including Raptors' valiant Powell, nets are also very interested. In addition, Mingji revealed that if McGrady is bought by the Cavaliers, the nets are very confident to win McGrady. Nets to compete for the capital of these players is the big three, they are now the champion of the biggest popular team!
