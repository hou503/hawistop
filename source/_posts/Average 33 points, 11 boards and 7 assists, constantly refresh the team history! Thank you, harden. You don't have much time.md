NBA regular season has entered the second half of the schedule, now the ranking is basically stable, the eastern three legs, 76 people have been pressing the net half, Bucks behind the two teams 50 meters, and other teams behind the three teams at least half a lap. The eastern region is really fierce this season. As the dominant bucks in the past few regular season, this season's performance is relatively average. One thing is for sure, the trade of bradso + three first round signings for hollody, at least from the current point of view, has not achieved the expected results. Of course, the bucks are still the team that meets the strong and the weak, and the letter brother starts his own data storm mode.

In the past 20 games, he was able to score 30.1 points, 12.0 rebounds, 6.7 assists, 1.5 steals and 1.6 blocks, with a shooting percentage of 57.1%. In the past 10 games, he averaged 32.5 points, 11.2 rebounds and 6.6 assists, leading the team to 9-1. This data performance is really enough to compete for the top five or even the top three of MVP. You know, in the past two seasons, brother Letterman beat harden and James in a row and won the MVP twice when the data is not dominant. And this season, the letter brother is not optimistic, once fell to eighth. Is his regular season dominance gone?

In the first game, he scored 33 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists. In the second game, he scored 31 points, 15 rebounds and 10 assists. In two consecutive games, he scored 30 + triple doubles with a 60% shooting rate. He became the first player to play this number in recent 53 years, and the last one was Chamberlain in 1968. The second world war with the wizard is the third time in the letter brother's career to get 30 + 15 + 10. Since 1983, it is the fourth time in history, next only to weishao (5 times), bird (5 times) and dongqiqi (4 times)! In the past three games, the letter brother cut three pairs in a row, the first person in the history of the team! The Bucks' next fight is the first 76ers in the East. Brother Letterman said in an interview: "they are now the first in the east? It's tough. Hopefully we can score some goals. We're going to try to end the trip in a good way, not to win, but to play well

Maybe brother alphabet is too modest, maybe brother alphabet is too proud. The important thing is that in the regular season, as long as the Bucks don't meet the teams that can match the strength of the Bucks, such as the Lakers, the clippers, the nets and the green army, the data of the letter brother is always gorgeous and can't find any fault. To score, to score, to be efficient is also the top of the league, scoring, assists, defense grasp, play and start to attack MVP? No team in the league is bucks in this mode. Letterman has the right to play the ball and has unlimited fire power. There are many teammates who have the ability to average 10 points per game, but they can't be the helpers of Letterman, including Middleton. No one can keep their form without consistent ball power, only Letterman can. If you get MVP again, can you convince people?

Thanks to harden for lifting the veil. In the past, harden was as big as brother alphabet. He didn't want to waste any more energy on the defensive side, and he was able to carry the team into the playoffs easily. At that time, harden couldn't compete with brother alphabet in the MVP competition. Indeed, brother alphabet was superior in terms of team performance and game viewing. But when harden came from the west to the East and joined the nets, he sacrificed his scoring data to help role players improve in the regular season. He and Owen easily led the nets to the second place in the East without Durant! Yes, brother alphabet does not have any helpers, but when brother alphabet is in the regular season, have you ever thought of helping his teammates to improve by sharing the ball? When books come to use, you hate less. When you are caught in the playoffs, it's too late to think of your teammates.

Behind the gorgeous data of letter brother is that he has no projection ability. He has not improved in the past eight years since he entered the league, and his free throw hit rate is even in decline. Indeed, with his physical talent, he is easy to average 30 + 10 + 5 per game, but why he has been stagnant? He once said that free throw means more practice, and projection means more practice, and there is no shortcut. Did he work hard behind his back? Did he meet the status quo and lie on the credit Book Thinking about how to dunk in fancy show? At the critical moment, brother alphabet has no projection ability, so he can only become a spectator! In addition, the letter brother will not take the initiative to defend the opposite super giant at the critical moment, this, he and old Zhan, small card, ADU they can't compare.

There's not much time left for brother alphabet. The competition in the East is fierce this season. The nets are the leader. Harden Owen leads the team to bite the 76ers. They also have Durant, who can rival James in the playoffs. The nets are the top in the league in terms of overall strength and team cohesion, because harden is using sacrifice to improve his teammates. Needless to say, the heat are the nightmares of bucks and brother Letterman. Even if Claude is gone, there are olenico, Nan, Iguodala and butler. Are they afraid of bucks? On the front line, the 76ers are not inferior to the heat this year. Green, Simmons and Harris are all good defensive players, as well as enbid Howard. They are in the top four in the East. The Bucks have only the letter brother. Originally, they also had blood cloth, who was selected as the best defensive team, and was used as a trading supplement in exchange for huoledi, who had no ball right. There's not much time left for brother alphabet. Maybe I realize that only the regular season belongs to me!
