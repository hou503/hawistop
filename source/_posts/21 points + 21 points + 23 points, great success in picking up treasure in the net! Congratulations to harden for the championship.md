One fence, three stakes, one hero, three gangs. In today's era, it's difficult to succeed only by fighting alone, and so is the NBA. Winning the championship is never the accumulation of simple giants. At the beginning, the Lakers also had five Giants: Kobe, Gasol, Nash, Howard and Artest. They only played seventh in the west, and they were swept out of the playoffs! Giants need to play a leading role, and the role players around must come forward at some time, save the team in the fire, pull the building in the general! It has to be said that the off-season basketball net has been a great success in picking up treasure. The 35 year old veteran, with a base salary, has played the value of tens of millions of contracts. He is Jeff Green.

The nets really suffered from injuries this season, playing very twists and turns. At first, Owen and Durant led the team, but the effect was not so good. At that time, they lost to the Hornets, grizzlies, eagles and wizards, and the team had no chemical reaction at all. After that, Owen disappeared for a long time. When harden returned, Owen also officially returned. But not long after that, Durant suffered from hamstring strain due to long-time high-intensity combat. Durant absent for 50 days, Owen stop and go, harden led the team alone, the net is smooth to the East first, but harden was injured again! It seems that the paper lineup of the nets is powerful, but there are not many players who can really rely on the whole season. Jeff Green is one of the few.

This season, Jeff Green averaged 26.9 minutes per game, with 10.3 points, 3.8 rebounds and 1.4 assists. His shooting percentage was 49%, and his three-point percentage was 41.8%. His three-point percentage was second only to Harris and Durant! In the last three games, against the Hornets, green played 31 minutes, 8 in 17, 5 in 12, with a total of 21 points, 8 rebounds and 2 assists. In the absence of harden, Jeff Green played Owen's most stable scoring point, fixed-point three-point projection, and participated in the defense, including the basket guard. Jeff Green did his best in every aspect. Against the bulls, Jeff Green played 25 minutes, 7 in 12, 4 in 6 with 3-pointer, and got 21 points, 1 rebound and 2 assists. Facing the Bulls led by vucevich and raven, the net is not easy to play without harden, while green holds the second highest score of the team and joins Owen to win at the last moment of the game!

In the recent game against the Knicks, the net only won 2 points, which was very difficult. Harden played for 4 minutes, and the Knicks pressed forward step by step. Green didn't feel good in this game, 6 in 15, 7 in 3-point, 2 in 7, but green still got 23 points and 4 rebounds. It was he and Harris who led a wave of high tide in the third quarter that leveled the point difference and rushed to the interior line Fouls, 13 free throws and 9 hits, including two free throws that won the game. After the game, Harris praised green: a best teammate who can always be trusted at the critical moment. That's true. You know, Green's annual salary is only $2.56 million. With the lowest salary, he's doing the job of 20 million stars. If he didn't come forward in these three games, Owen alone would be hard to resist.

Congratulations on the success of the net! In fact, there are many role players in this season's basketball net who have shown a strong fighting capacity, which is inseparable from harden's efforts. With Clarkston's ability to end under the basket, Bruce Brown plays efficiently. Although he is shorter than harden, his efficiency of air cutting and throwing is not inferior to Clarkston. Including the basket shooter Harris, the three-point shooting rate is as high as 48%, Nash's hands are not short of people, they just lack the opportunity to show their ability. With the arrival of Adelaide and Griffin, little Jordan has been abandoned, but as long as you work hard, you will get the opportunity to show yourself. Azley Johnson is a good example. Nash should also trust the role players and let Owen and harden rest properly. He is really not afraid of losing in the regular season.

Jeff Green has all the qualities and advantages that a veteran should have. He can play in No. 4 and No. 5 positions. He has the ability to shoot three points and attack with the ball. In addition, whether in Owen's side or in harden's side, green can play to their strengths, provide help to the superstar partner, and lead the team to win together. In the off-season, Jeff Green was still ignored. After his contract with the Rockets ended, the Rockets abandoned him. After the free market opened, he signed with the nets until the fourth day. How could the Lakers, the clippers and the Bucks miss such a high-quality forward player at that time? Now green has become one of the best role players in the nets, he is also the perfect match for harden Durant and Owen to fight for the championship!
