In this game, when Schroeder was present, the record of the Lakers was 7-2, while Schroeder was absent, the record of the Lakers was 0-4.

Schroeder can play the offensive strength of breakthrough with the ball, and also feed Kuzma, Harrell and tucker. Schroeder is gradually integrating into the system of the Lakers, which is a good thing. The Lakers need to give the new players time to adapt. For James, the recent performance is too eye-catching.

There is still good news after the Lakers win. The Jazz lost to the Wizards today, and Williams and bill led the team to complete the reversal. In addition, the Suns lost to the wolves at the bottom of the league. Downes and Edwards scored 83 points. Edwards broke five records in the first World War. The reason why the Suns collapsed in the fourth quarter was very simple. Paul and Booker were defeated by Edwards. The two major competitors lost at the same time. The Lakers not only surpassed the Suns to the second place in the west, but also were only 1.5 games away from the jazz. In addition, the Lakers had 2.5 games away from the Clippers! Now the jazz has become the public enemy of the league, and the Lakers are in an invincible position. Davis can be at ease to recover. He is looking forward to Kuzma, Harrell and Schroeder playing more steadily!
