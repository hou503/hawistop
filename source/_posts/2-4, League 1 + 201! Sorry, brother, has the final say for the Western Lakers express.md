This season, the west is really messy. The two most popular winners, the Lakers and the clippers, are only in the third or fourth place. The rise of jazz and Suns is unexpected. From mid January to the end of February, the Jazz won 20 of their 22 games, only losing to the clippers and nuggets! Judging from the current winning rate, the Jazz's winning rate of 73.7% is still the highest in the league, and the only team with a winning rate of more than 70% in the league. Can we list the jazz as the most popular team to win the championship this season? Sorry, they are too young. It's not that they are too strong this season. The main reason is that the Lakers and Clippers are disappointing this season.

In a recent match, the Jazz beat the warriors 119-131. Of course, I don't like to use the word "chill" to describe the warriors beating the jazz, because the skinny camel is bigger than the horse, and the warriors' paper strength can compete with the jazz. In the last six games, the Jazz have beaten the heat, the eastern magic, the pelicans and the 76ers in extra time. Especially in the game of defeating the Rockets, I once thought that the Rockets would end the 15 consecutive losses, because both Porter and Martin could take the Rockets to catch up with the difference in the fourth quarter and stomp Jazz coach Snyder. It's so hard for the Rockets to fight back. After the opening performance of high light, jazz slowly fell down from the altar!

Let's talk about Mitchell first. Mitchell is really a young star with great personality. At the beginning, he fought rockets, harden in the playoffs and James in the all star weekend. He is not afraid of anything. He has been in the NBA for four years with sharp edges. This season's average is 24.8 points + 4.6 rebounds + 5.4 assists, compared with the rookie season's average is 20.5 points + 3.8 rebounds + 3.7 assists, there is not much improvement, because his shooting percentage is declining, the improvement of data is only due to the increase of the number of shots. In addition, among the 23 players who have scored more than 800 points this season, these players are naturally the absolute core number one of each team. Mitchell's total score ranks 15th in the league, but Mitchell's shooting percentage is only 41.9%, which is the lowest among these 23 players, but Mitchell's total shot times is the fourth in the League!

As the leading core of the league, Mitchell's advanced efficiency is very general. His round share is the seventh in the league, which is absolutely the proportion of ball rights owned by super giant talents. However, Mitchell's game contribution value is only 12.2, ranking 63rd in the league. What are the players of the same level? Grant of the pistons, van fritt of the Raptors, Collins of the eagles and general wall of the Rockets. This contribution value, it's really hard to be an all star! Mitchell's real shooting rate is only 54.9%, ranking 201 in the league. This effective list (with time limit) has only 330 people in total. Mitchell's shooting efficiency is the lower level in the League! It's not hard to explain why the Jazz have been losing recently, playing 76ers, Mitchell's 34 shots, 12 goals, pelicans, 7 in 21, rockets, 9 in 23, and his shooting rate can't even exceed 40%.

How should Jazz win? To be honest, jazz's success this season is based on fierce defense and collective outburst of role players. Boyang, Conley, Clarkson and Mitchell all hit more than 37% of the three-point shots. In addition, goebbell can effectively protect the frame. There are always 1-2 players in each game. This is not a superstar ball, which weakens Mitchell's role. But if Mitchell takes the lead, he will not be able to play A large number of shots, jazz overall offensive efficiency will decline significantly. Before the all star weekend, the Jazz ranked fourth in the offensive efficiency League, fourth in the defensive efficiency League, and first in the net efficiency League. They are the only team with offensive and defensive efficiency in the top five of the league.

In the last six games, their offensive efficiency ranked 10th in the league and defensive efficiency ranked 21st in the league. Why did they suddenly drop so fast? In fact, the reason is very simple. Their own mentality has changed. At the beginning of the season, no one was optimistic about them. They were just an impactor, a challenger, to challenge the Lakers and the Clippers. In the middle of the season, the Jazz became the number one in the league. When they were young, they suddenly found that they had become defenders of the challenge arena. That confidence would turn into conceit at any time. In the game against the 76ers, Mitchell left in extra time and attacked the referee after the game. Gerber even said frankly that we were targeted by the league and we always got unfair treatment. But to be honest, in the past two seasons, the Jazz got the most favorable and wrong judgments. Old fans must remember that Ingram was beaten twice by goebbell, including the Trail Blazers who were wrongly overturned, and lilard was even more aggrieved at that time!

When James and Durant left Mitchell and Gerber to the last, Mitchell's mentality quietly changed. If they were not the first in the West and the first in the league, how could they dare to attack James and even say, "I don't want to swear, but we are not seeking his support." All star is originally a game of leisure and entertainment. Why are you so competitive? It's not good to learn to respond like a superstar, for example, "James is right, but we hope to change people's views on jazz through our performance in the future." Do you have to be reasonable? It's not necessarily a good thing to be famous when you are young. Just like the Jazz now, if you are in the limelight too early, you will only hurt yourself. In the final analysis, the west is still the world of the Lakers and the Clippers.
