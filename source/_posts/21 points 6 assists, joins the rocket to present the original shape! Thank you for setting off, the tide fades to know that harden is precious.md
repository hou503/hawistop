There must be something hateful about poor people. That's OK. Guo Degang once said: it's not that I'm outstanding, it's mainly the foil of my peers. In the recent game, the Rockets suffered a 107-134 defeat against Celtic. The result is not unexpected. I want to say that the players in this game, including Porter, Martin, oradibo and Tate, are all worthy of praise. They really didn't give up from the beginning to the end and played very seriously. They really just didn't have enough strength. We can't blame the Rockets too much. Now, it's not a question of when the Rockets will end their losing streak. They really can't win. They should try their best to attack the number one draw. General wall spoke.

The Rockets suffered 16 consecutive losses, setting a new record for the longest consecutive loss after the team moved to Houston. Before the game, wall posted his own entrance show, dressed up in casual clothes, with a piece of soul soup: "the winner is not never failure, but never give up." In my intuitive understanding, this sentence should be: "it's OK to lose, just pretend we can win the next game." Wall is absent for three consecutive games. The official injury given by the Rockets is a bruised left knee. He is expected to return in the game against the hawks and at the same time with wood. It is generally believed that that game is the best time for the Rockets to end their losing streak. If I say something ugly, I really underestimate the eagles. The eagles have won the last five games in a row, but they haven't lost after the change of coach. Before Capella had a rotation break, waiting for the Rockets to attack your defense. Do you still want to win the eagles? Does Liang Jingru give you courage?

This season, wall has played 25 games on behalf of the Rockets, averaging 21 points + 6 assists + 3.2 rebounds per game. It seems that the data is not bad, but the efficiency is terrible. Wall's net efficiency is - 6.4, 257th in the league, and his real hit rate is 52.4%. He is 257th in the league, and his round share is 31.8%. This can be ranked in the top five in the league, and is the first level in the league with enbid, Letterman, Lillard, etc No, but his contribution to the game is 12.0, 69th in the league. He is on the same level as King Center Holmes, piston center pramley and Suns player sharlich. Simple straight white point, holding the right to the ball does not work, holding a high salary but when the son.

On March 2, the Rockets beat the Cavaliers. In that game, the Rockets had the hope of ending their losing streak. Wall volunteered to play back-to-back. As the Rockets were really short of players, Silas agreed to his request. In an interview before the game, wall said: "unless I'm really injured, I don't want to miss every game. I'm born to be competitive. I love the game. I'd rather play without pay. I give 110% in every game. That's me. I love the stadium That game, wall 24 in 11, got 32 points, but the Rockets still lost. Two days later, the Rockets met the nets, and in the game when harden got the quasi four doubles, wall really tried his best to win the nets. He went out for 41 minutes, 12 in 30, 5 in 12 three-point, and got a season high of 36 points. In the fourth quarter, harden Owen made a big effort, and the Rockets were defeated. After that, wall was injured and rested for two weeks.

It's fierce. I didn't mean to satirize him. I just didn't expect to lead the team to lose two games in a row. When I cut 68 points, I paid a truce for two weeks. With his current physique and physical condition, he averages 30 minutes, 21 points and 6 assists, which is his limit. But if Tate, little Porter and little Martin have the ball right of wall, will their performance be worse than that of wall? The answer must be no, wall's inefficient performance has become the team's biggest short board, of course, with him or not, he is losing, why not take the opportunity to exercise young players? Does the Rockets expect wall to help rebuild the team? Taking this season into account, wall's contract still has three years and $130 million left, including $40.82 million for this season, $43.85 million for next season and $46.87 million for 22-23 season with player options.

Mingji Scott confirmed that those executives who had communication with the rocket management revealed that at present, only wood is not for sale, while wall is not. Of course, the Rockets want to sell wall, but who is willing to take over the three-year $130 million contract? Rockets want to send people, most of them need to catch the first round of signing, but Rockets need to use the first round of signing in exchange for harden deal to clean up wall? Juan Duran, a famous writer, thinks that the Rockets must send away wall now. There are two plans: first, trade with the Spurs, send out wall and Gordon in exchange for Adelaide and Derozan, and clear the salary space directly in the summer. However, the Rockets must make the first round signing, because wall's contract is too bad. Second, trade with raptors, rockets in exchange for Lori and Powell, raptors get wall. Of course, the previous record of IKE revealed that as long as the first round of signing is not reversed, it can be accepted! Now it's time to know what position wall is in the Rockets.

Join the rocket now! Thanks to wall, let us know that harden is so precious. In fact, the Rockets are not so unbearable this season. At the beginning, harden also took a group of draft losers back to the top four in the western region, but looking at the current league, only harden has the ability to lead the team in the regular season. At that time, there were only Gerald Green, chamotte, Ennis and little rivers around harden. But now, let alone wall himself, it's hard for wall + oradibo + Gordon to lead the team. Can wood really save the Rockets? Come on, maybe the Rockets can end the losing streak, but wall has let the fans see the team's upper limit, the league's last three!
