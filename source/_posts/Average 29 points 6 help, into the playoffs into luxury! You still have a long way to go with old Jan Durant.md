Sun Tzu has a saying: "thick but can't make, love but can't make, chaos but can't rule, can't use." As a popular saying goes: benevolence does not command soldiers! The same is true in the NBA. If you want to lead the team to the championship, you want to stand on the top of the historical stage. In addition to being the absolute leader on the court and the absolute core of the team, the most important thing is to have the judgment and control over the team. Maybe you don't quite understand the meaning of these words. Let me give two simple examples. Why has old Zhan been able to reach the finals in the past 10 years? Because he knows what he wants. Why did the nets dominate in just one year? Because Durant knows that if he wants to win the championship, he needs help, harden, Griffin and Adelaide! Yes, Durant's recruitment is leadership. Lao Zhan's ability to stand on the top of the League for a long time is leadership.

The warrior lost again! In a recent game, the warriors lost 109-116 to the heat, and curry scored 36 points and 11 rebounds in 36 minutes, of which 11 rebounds equaled a career high in a single game. In the past six games, due to the injury of curry's tailbone, he was absent from the game continuously. As a result, the warriors lost all kinds of games, including Grizzlies, 76ers, King hawks, bulls, curry came back, won with ease and pleasure, heat and lost again! After the game, curry complained: "we haven't found a team we can rely on so far. We are experiencing too much growing pains, but we can't complain too much. We have to move on." One thing we can see is that curry tried his best when the warriors lost. When curry was absent this season, the warriors' record was 1-6, while curry was 22-19, with a victory rate of 55%. Assuming that the next game in curry is endless, what is the final record of the warriors in the west? With 24 games left, the warriors are 37-35 at most.

This can't make it into the top six or even the top ten in the West! what do you mean? Even if curry continues to play with the team, wouldn't it be embarrassing if the warriors couldn't even get into the playoffs? But now the warriors only rank 10th in the west, only 1 game ahead of the kings and 1.5 games ahead of the pelicans! Warriors play like this, and Cole has an inseparable relationship, Cole is a stubborn old man, his mind on a tactic: pass cut. He will always have only one dealer on the court: green. He will never play until he has about seven minutes left in the fourth quarter, no matter how the warriors were beaten by their opponents in the previous five minutes. Of course, Cole will see people under the dish, Wiseman is the top, it should play the first, no matter how bad his performance!

Warriors' total salary this season is 173 million US dollars. According to this salary, they need to pay 138 million US dollars in luxury tax, which is higher than the salary of 25 teams such as the Lakers and bucks. If clay's 35 million US dollars is left, there is 138 million US dollars left to build a team. If you say you can't enter the playoffs, who can blame? Even if it is stumbling into the playoffs, I'm afraid people will feel disappointed. The head coach will inevitably have to carry the pot. What about the core of the team? As curry, is he responsible? At the beginning, whether the warriors traded Russell for Wiggins or renewed Green's contract for four years and $100 million, including a special case for the right to use ubre for one year, warriors boss ragb and general manager miles should at least communicate with curry. Curry doesn't know. In other words, all this is in the acquiescence of curry, set up the framework of this team.

Yes, it's all because of Cole. In the era of clay, Livingston and Iguodala, the warriors' passing and cutting play combined with the water brothers' unsolved three-point ball made the opponent unable to figure out his fate. Later, Durant became the winner and loser. In addition, Paul of rockets was injured in those two years, and harden Paul had infighting. The Warriors also easily passed through all the way. Maybe the success of the past few years makes Cole and curry think that this kind of playing method, even if a few players are changed, as long as there are green and curry, is still useful. The more ubre throws, the less confident he is. Wiggins has a stable performance of 16-18 points. It's no fault to Wiggins. How many tactics has Cole arranged for him? At the end of the day, this is the consensus reached by Cole and curry.

Everyone's not comfortable playing! Curry was daily trapped, there was no offensive space, teammates did not have a good chance, empty out also dare not throw. Warriors defense is not bad, but all the offensive players have no sense of position. If they are strong or not, the team with a winning rate of more than 50% has a worse record than thunder. If curry is not strong enough to throw and hit, they may not be able to play the whole game. We can't blame Wiggins, Wiseman who has high eyes and low hands, and ubre who has no confidence in shooting. When he decided to win them, they didn't necessarily agree to play with clay and Livingston's masks. Warriors boss is not short of money, what players need to do everything in the limited salary space! But will curry be as tough as Jen and Durant?

Don't be merciful! The success of the warriors in the past few years is the success of the system. Of course, curry's role is absolutely irreplaceable. But now it seems that if curry can't lead this high paid team to the playoffs, it can only prove that he lacks leadership. It's hard to hear, but it's also a reality.
