The nets now have Durant + harden + Owen + Griffin + Adelaide + little Jordan and other multi giant lineups, but they still haven't given up the chance to strengthen. According to reporter Max Stein's view, before the trade deadline, the nets had tried to send away Ding Weidi, and the nets have listed many offers for Ding Weidi. Ding Weidi only played three games on behalf of the nets this season, because of partial tears of the right cruciate ligament, missing so far! At that time, it was said that this season, but now the situation has changed a lot. Ding Weidi's injury recovery progress is far better than expected, Ding Weidi is expected to play the role of harden substitute in the playoffs, leading the second team! Congratulations to the nets. There's no suspense this season.

Trading window period, the nets really want to send away Ding Weidi, and the warriors to discuss Ding Weidi for ubre, the warriors refused. Discuss with the heat about haakles + Bradley + Nan for Ding Weidi, but later because of Lori, the heat withdrew from the negotiation with the nets. In addition, the Raptors also had talks with the nets about the exchange of Dwight Ding and Powell. In addition, the pistons, the Pacers, the rockets and even the Bulls all wanted Dwight Ding, but they couldn't get any decent chips. So, Dwight Ding was lucky to stay in the nets, which became a good thing! Last season, Ding Weidi played 64 games on behalf of the nets, averaging 20.6 points, 6.8 assists, 3.5 rebounds and 21 + 7 + 4, which is absolutely the threshold standard for a first-class guard. And Ding Weidi's biggest advantage is that he works hard, does not fight, plays the substitute, does not complain, lets him play the first round, the performance is better. But I love to study some black technology things when I have nothing to do. Here we will not do in-depth discussion.

And after the off-season training camp opened, according to the nets reporter pacio revealed that in the single challenge practice of the nets team, Ding Weidi only lost to Durant, he even teased Owen too short. And last season, it was Ding Weidi who led the team. Without Durant and Owen, he led the remnant basketball net to the seventh position in the East, 35-37, and locked the playoff qualification early. In the words of the temporary coach of the nets, Jacques Vaughn, Ding Weidi saw Kobe's shadow! From the 38th pick by the pistons in the first round to being traded to the basketball net, Ding Weidi has gradually become the core of the team. Every year, his growth and improvement are very obvious. Now it's time for him to come back!

During the closing date of the transaction, Ding Weidi updated his social platform: "the first stage of rehabilitation has just been completed, and the recovery process is still continuing. Come on!" According to the columnist bital's report, Ding Weidi's current recovery is far faster than expected. At the beginning, the right cruciate ligament tear confirmed the season reimbursement. The expected recovery time is 6-8 months. Ding Weidi completed the first stage of health in only 3 months. He has a chance to return to the team before the playoffs in mid May! And team reporter PASIO also revealed that Ding Weidi has a 60% chance to catch up with the playoffs, and Ding Weidi often goes to the training hall of the nets recently to train. It is expected that he can increase the intensity in the team training match within three weeks. It is only a matter of time before he returns. How terrible will the nets be at that time?

Of course, first of all, it needs to be emphasized that there is a special case of Ding Weidi's injury in the nets. Before Ding Weidi's comeback, if the nets use the special case, the players who replace Ding Weidi can play with Ding Weidi. But Ding Weidi once comeback, but the rebound net has not used the injury special case, that special case void. So the nets are still concentrating on strengthening, looking for flankers all over the world. If Ding Weidi can come back in the playoffs, this net will be very terrible! Starting: harden + Owen + jorha + Durant + Adelaide, substituting: Ding Weidi + brown + Jeff Green + Griffin + little Jordan, in addition to Clarkston, ruwau, Johnson such important role players, this for NASH and d'antony, is the happiness of trouble, endless!

To be honest, the nets may not need Ding Weidi at this stage, but in the playoffs, Ding Weidi must be needed to share the task of harden's game. Harden averaged 38.7 minutes this season. In March, harden averaged 40 minutes. What he has to do is not only to organize and connect, but also to defend. This is too much pressure for harden. Harden also needs someone to help him. Ding Weidi must be the most suitable person to organize the ball, have a tacit understanding with Owen, and have a certain offensive ability Defense is also good. Once Ding Weidi returns, there will be no suspense in NBA this season. At least there is no team in the East that can compete with them!
