In the summer of 2016, Durant decided to leave thunder and join warriors. Since then, he has been called a traitor. But to be honest, the pursuit of championship is the ultimate dream of every professional player, which is not unforgivable, and in the thunder years, it seems so close to the championship, but always so far away. Joining the warriors, two champions, two finals MVP, Durant and the warriors get what they need. In the summer of 19, Durant risked losing his career and played 12 minutes in the G5 finals with a broken Achilles tendon and a one-year truce! Now Durant has come back and is reborn in the net. This time, it's Durant. Brother, you really don't want to give Jen a living.

In the summer of 2016, Zhan led the team to join Owen to defeat the warriors 4-3 in the finals, which made the warriors, who won 73 in the regular season, the laughing stock of many fans. But because of Durant's joining, the balance of the original balance falls directly to the warrior side, because Durant can fight against Lao Zhan himself, and the rest of the knight can't compete with curry, clay, igodara and green! In the 17 year finals, Durant averaged 35.2 points + 8.2 rebounds + 5.4 assists per game. Curry and clay threw them casually. Durant always stood up at the critical moment to open the gap. The whole Cavaliers could do nothing for Durant, including old Zhan! In the summer of 18, Owen also left. Zhan ate oranges and carried the team all the way to the finals. Zhan averaged 34 points + 10 assists + 8.5 rebounds. Durant averaged 28.8 points + 10.8 rebounds + 7.5 assists. He swept the Cavaliers and won the MVP of the finals twice in a row. It was so simple to beat Zhan.

I still remember last year's finals, the heat core Butler said: "you see, our playoff journey is so difficult, but we all the way to the finals, LeBron is there, waiting for us there. We all know that if we want to win the championship, we must beat LeBron. He is like the boss in the last stage of the game. You can't escape him Yes, only the warrior can defeat old Zhan and his cavalry. There is a system with enough shape and unlimited running. In addition, Durant has the advantage of absolute arrow dislocation. Durant is equivalent to the last safety valve given by the warrior to the cavalry, and forcibly takes the cavalry apart: Durant vs LeBron James, other warriors vs others. And don't forget, at that time, in addition to Durant, there were curry, clay, green, igordala, including the later cousins, the warrior of the big five era, which made "grand finale" the buzzword of that year.

One was not recognized by the warriors, and the other was not happy in Celtic. Owen and Durant decided to join hands, and the nets gave them a platform. At that time, there were Allen, Lowell, Dwight, Prince, Harris and others, and the team was at the playoff level. After that, harden didn't see any hope in the Rockets for 8 years. When he tried with Paul and weishao and found that they were not the partners he needed, harden thought of Durant and Owen. One is the one who can fight against Lao Zhan, the other is the one who can turn the tide in the finals. Harden got what he wanted, and the big three took root in the net. When Durant has been recovering for a long time and Owen stops and starts, but harden still leads the team to hold the second place in the East, he suddenly understands this idea of leading the team. Harden is the brain of the team, the organizer, Owen is the scorer, and Durant is the eukaryote of the three giants. The playoffs still depend on Durant.

Owen and Jordan joined the best team for 32 times without hesitation. The objective reality is that Griffin has suffered a serious injury, and his condition can't be compared with that of the Clippers. Little Jordan and Adelaide are old, and their contribution is limited. However, Griffin slammed in the first game when he came to the nets. He easily scored 17 points against his old team pistons. The air connection with harden was amazing. With harden's blessing in series, what if Griffin and Adelaide glow in the second spring? The nets have made a lot of money, and the most desperate are the Lakers and Jen.

Yes, as the first person in the active League, everyone wants to beat Jen. Former Cavaliers teammate Frye once said, what bad idea can Owen have? He doesn't hate Jen, he just wants to beat him. In any industry or field, people who are in the leading position will always be targeted. At the beginning, the warriors accumulated strength, but now the nets accumulated strength, just to more easily defeat Zhan, and let the 36 year old Zhan slowly fall from the altar. Of course, as the only one who can challenge Lao Zhan, Durant naturally became the leader in everyone's heart. Durant is a lucky man. It's no surprise that the wind of group is not Durant's first creation. It's just that at the age of 36, it's really cruel to treat old Zhan like this.
