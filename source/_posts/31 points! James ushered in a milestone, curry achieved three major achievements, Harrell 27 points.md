Curry played 29 minutes, 9 in 17, 4 in 7, and achieved three great achievements! First: 100 games in a row have three-point goals, ranking third in history! It is worth mentioning that the first place is 157 Games held by curry and the second place is 127 Games held by kovar. Second: in this game, curry sent out 2 assists, and his career assists reached 4856, surpassing the warriors' famous guest Rogers and becoming the champion of assists in the history of the warriors! Third: Curry got 27 points in this game, with a total career score of 17531 points, surpassing Jason Kidd and ranking 85th in NBA history. The reason why the warriors lost today is very simple. Curry didn't get much help. Ubre's defense was useless. Green's offensive end was invisible.

On the Laker's side, James scored 22 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists. This is James's fourth triple double this season and his 98th triple double in his career. James became the only player in NBA history who won 10 triple doubles after 35 years old. Compared with warriors, there are too many players available on the Laker side! In fact, today, whether it's pop or Harrell or Kuzma, they really dare to fight and never hesitate to have a good chance. Harrell, in particular, almost hit Wiseman and Rooney in the opposite position. Kuzma is more and more steady, and pop is gradually finding a sense of breaking up. Role players keep this state. Davis has no problem resting until the start of the playoffs! Keep going. I hope you don't pull again in the next game.
