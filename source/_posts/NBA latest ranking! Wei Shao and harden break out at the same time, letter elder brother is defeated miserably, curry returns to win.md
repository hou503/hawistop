In the latest Western ranking, the Jazz are 35-11, basically locked in the top position. The Clippers hold on to the sun after a wave of six consecutive wins. The Lakers are now 30-17, ranking fourth, with nuggets and pioneers coveting. After four consecutive defeats, the warriors are now one game ahead of the kings and are under great pressure. Why is the piston a little difficult? At present, the Timberwolves have the worst record in the league, while the Rockets have a 13-33 record. The Rockets, Timberwolves and pistons are competing, but the magic are closely following them 15-31. If the pistons continue to win, they will be farther and farther away from the number one signing. The competition is fierce enough. It's a play to cheat each other. Who should today's star choose? Harden or vissau?
