In the latest ranking of the eastern region, the nets and the 76ers did not play, ranking in the top two in the eastern region. After the Bucks lost, the gap between them was widened. How about brother letterman's knee injury? Hornets, eagles, heat and green army are still lingering together, regardless of you and me. After the Bulls beat the Raptors, there is less hope for the latter teams to enter the playoffs. Pistons have nothing to do with the world. Win a ball to prove that they have been in the world.

In the latest Western ranking, the Jazz won, the Suns lost, and the gap between the two teams widened to 2.5 games. After beating the sun, the clipper took the third place with a relatively stable position. The Lakers lost, but the Trail Blazers behind didn't grasp the opportunity. Now the biggest suspense in the western region is the three teams of the Lakers, the Trail Blazers and the lone ranger. Who can get the straight through ticket to the playoffs? Hopefully the Lakers will hold the top six in the west before Jens returns. The gap behind is relatively large. After the thunder's five consecutive losses, they still can't see the exhaust gas of the Rockets. That's the gap!
