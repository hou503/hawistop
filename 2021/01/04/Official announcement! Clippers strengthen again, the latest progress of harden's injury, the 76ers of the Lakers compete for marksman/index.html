        <p>Beijing time on April 6, the NBA regular season continues, in the morning nets and the Knicks game, harden retired from injury, after the game, Nash and nets reporters also reported the latest progress of harden. In the case of harden’s withdrawal, Owen stormed away and set a number of records in a row. The Lakers also have good news. Davis is recovering well, and the Lakers are interested in mcclemo, who has just been bought out by the Rockets. In addition, the Clippers officially signed corhines, the pioneers also continue to strengthen.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/04/Official%20announcement!%20Clippers%20strengthen%20again,%20the%20latest%20progress%20of%20harden's%20injury,%20the%2076ers%20of%20the%20Lakers%20compete%20for%20marksman/602cd4dd-f4c3-4978-a6da-78910fdf7c5e.gif" alt="Official announcement! Clippers strengthen again, the latest progress of harden&#39;s injury, the 76ers of the Lakers compete for marksman"><br>**The latest development of harden’s injury! **<br>After the Knicks game, Nash said in an interview: “during the game, he realized that there was something wrong with his hamstring. He didn’t find any abnormality during the examination this morning, and he also showed normal performance when testing strength in the dressing room. Conservative, decided to let him out of the game, has not given his comeback schedule According to the follow-up report of the nets reporter, the inspection shows that harden’s hamstring has no structural damage, and the team will be more careful to protect harden, harden may enter the daily injury observation list after a period of absence. And teammate Harris also revealed that after the half-time and the game, harden made a speech in the dressing room to motivate his teammates. It didn’t seem to matter. Nets really should take good care of harden, Durant is still recovering, and then tired harden, the gain is not worth the loss.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/04/Official%20announcement!%20Clippers%20strengthen%20again,%20the%20latest%20progress%20of%20harden's%20injury,%20the%2076ers%20of%20the%20Lakers%20compete%20for%20marksman/113a72a1-ddb1-4f86-9a0c-f1b21b9a5165.gif" alt="Official announcement! Clippers strengthen again, the latest progress of harden&#39;s injury, the 76ers of the Lakers compete for marksman"><br>**Irving set a magic record! **<br>In the game with the Knicks, Owen played 37 minutes, 15 in 28, 5 in 12, scored 40 points, 2 rebounds, 7 assists and 1 steals. This is Owen’s seventh time to get 40 + points after joining the nets, ranking third in the history of the nets, after Carter’s 17 times and Williamson’s 8 times. In addition, Owen has hit 57.5% + 39.2% + 90% in three events so far this season, which is infinitely close to 180 clubs! Owen also became the first nets player who scored 30 + in two consecutive games against the Knicks after Devon Harris in the 2008-09 season. In addition, Owen has averaged 28 points + 6.2 assists per game so far this season, with a two-point shooting rate of 57.5%, which is also the highest in Owen’s career!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/04/Official%20announcement!%20Clippers%20strengthen%20again,%20the%20latest%20progress%20of%20harden's%20injury,%20the%2076ers%20of%20the%20Lakers%20compete%20for%20marksman/d30b9fb6-4cf7-4de9-a486-6e0449649092.gif" alt="Official announcement! Clippers strengthen again, the latest progress of harden&#39;s injury, the 76ers of the Lakers compete for marksman"><br><strong>The Lakers and the 76ers are interested in signing mcclemo</strong><br>According to mossy, the source revealed that both the Lakers and the 76ers are interested in mcclemo. In addition, many teams have expressed strong interest in mcclemo. So far this season, mcclemo has averaged 7.4 points + 2.1 rebounds per game, with a three-point shooting rate of 33.1%, not getting too many playing opportunities. But in the last season, mclermo hit 40% of the three-point ball, can average 2.6 three-point ball, is a very stable three-point shooter. The Lakers are eager to find an outfield player who can provide firepower output, and now the guard line of the Lakers is short of rotation, and the platoon is stretched. It’s just that this time the Lakers are competing with the 76ers. Who can laugh to the end? In addition, pop said in an interview that thick eyebrow has started some personal shooting training. According to the previous reporter wenderhorst, Davis is expected to return in two weeks.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/04/Official%20announcement!%20Clippers%20strengthen%20again,%20the%20latest%20progress%20of%20harden's%20injury,%20the%2076ers%20of%20the%20Lakers%20compete%20for%20marksman/4f728055-8925-480a-a8b5-17c214aaafa0.gif" alt="Official announcement! Clippers strengthen again, the latest progress of harden&#39;s injury, the 76ers of the Lakers compete for marksman"><br>**The Clippers officially signed corhines! **<br>Although the clippers and cousins reached an early consensus, they have not signed a contract. After a long wait and various tests, the Clippers officially announced today that they will sign a 10 day contract with cousins, with a total salary of US $175000. At present, the only one in the League willing to give cousins a chance is the Clippers. After being bought out by the Rockets this season, koshins has not played for nearly 50 days, averaging 9.6 points, 7.6 rebounds and 2.4 assists. Interestingly, this is the fourth time that he and Rondo have become teammates. Before that, they have cooperated with kings, pelicans and the Lakers. Kaoxinsi’s arrival can at least alleviate the pressure of the Clippers’ interior. Ibaka has been absent for a long time, and it is difficult to rely on zubaz alone. I hope koshins can seize this opportunity.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/04/Official%20announcement!%20Clippers%20strengthen%20again,%20the%20latest%20progress%20of%20harden's%20injury,%20the%2076ers%20of%20the%20Lakers%20compete%20for%20marksman/75b029ae-088c-4e11-96e2-76aa7ccb7206.gif" alt="Official announcement! Clippers strengthen again, the latest progress of harden&#39;s injury, the 76ers of the Lakers compete for marksman"><br>​<br>**Four big three teams are ready! **<br>Previously, Huo ledi and bucks completed a four-year $135 million contract extension, with a total salary of $160 million, including 25 million bonus terms. According to the calculation of NBA salary expert Bob Marx, there will be four NBA teams and three players in the next season, and the total salary will exceed $100 million. Three big nets: Owen + harden + Durant, with a total salary of $121 million; three big Warriors: Clay + curry + Wiggins, with a total salary of $115 million; three big bucks: Letterman + Middleton + Holliday, with a total salary of $106 million; three big 76ers: enbid + Simmons + Harris, with a total salary of $100 million. The NBA will have less than $1.6 billion in contracts for next season. The gap between the rich and the poor is widening. The stronger the strong, the weaker the weak. Matthew effect is prominent. In addition, the Blazers also signed a two-way contract with former Pacers player Lifu, who averaged 3 points and 2.5 rebounds per game last season and could play No. 4 or No. 5.</p>
