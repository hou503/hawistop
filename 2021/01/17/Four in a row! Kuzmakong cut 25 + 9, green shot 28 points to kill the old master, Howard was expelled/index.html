Kuzmakong cut 25 + 9, green shot 28 points to kill the old master, Howard was expelled"><br>On March 26, Beijing time, the NBA regular season continued, with the Lakers at home against the 76ers. Before that, the Lakers had a 28-16 record, ranking fourth in the west, and the 76ers had a 31-13 record, ranking first in the East. Before the game, the Lakers also arranged the ring awarding ceremony of Howard and Denny green. It’s very warm to see the familiar Tielin and Warcraft smile happily. How nice it would be if they were still in the Lakers! The game was full of twists and turns. Howard was expelled before the end of the first quarter. Under the leadership of Denny green, the 76ers held the lead. The final score was 101-109. The Lakers lost 76 at home, suffered four losses in a row, and the 76ers won four in a row!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/17/Four%20in%20a%20row!%20Kuzmakong%20cut%2025%20+%209,%20green%20shot%2028%20points%20to%20kill%20the%20old%20master,%20Howard%20was%20expelled/1a4eec6c-c452-47ac-a46f-ad4f7700d61c.gif" alt="Four in a row! Kuzmakong cut 25 + 9, green shot 28 points to kill the old master, Howard was expelled"><br>Data, on the 76ers’ side, Daniel Green has 28 points and 5 rebounds, Harris has 17 points and 6 rebounds and 5 assists, little curry has 19 points, Simmons has 9 points and 9 rebounds and 12 assists, Milton has 12 points, Howard has 6 points and 2 rebounds and 2 blocks. On the Laker side, Kuzma has 25 points and 9 rebounds, Pop has 19 points and 4 rebounds and 3 assists, Schroeder has 20 points and 11 assists and 3 steals, and Harrell has 20 points and 8 rebounds.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/17/Four%20in%20a%20row!%20Kuzmakong%20cut%2025%20+%209,%20green%20shot%2028%20points%20to%20kill%20the%20old%20master,%20Howard%20was%20expelled/e32736b8-0c2c-4796-868c-f2eb59d960b4.gif" alt="Four in a row! Kuzmakong cut 25 + 9, green shot 28 points to kill the old master, Howard was expelled"><br>In the first quarter, the Lakers took the lead to enter the state. Pop and Schroeder made a series of strong attacks under the basket, and Gasol also scored three points after his comeback. The Lakers took the lead. After the 76ers held their ground, green and curry had a three-point rain, and a 13-3 climax easily overtook the Lakers. In the second half of the game, the Lakers didn’t lose points. Kuzma and Popper responded to a wave of three-point rain, while Howard ate Harrell alone in a row. Since then, the two sides had physical friction and extended sincere greetings to each other on Tomb Sweeping Day. Howard has been expelled for a total of two technical criminals. The 76ers are 27-24 in the first quarter. In the second quarter, Milton helped the 76ers get 5 points in a row, Tucker and Schroeder responded with 6 points. In the middle of the game, the two teams continued to attack under the basket, but the 76ers took the lead. Green and Scott scored three points in a row, which suddenly opened the gap. At the end of the game, the Lakers relied on pop’s three points, and Harrell and Schroeder constantly attacked under the basket to level the score, which was 54 in the half!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/17/Four%20in%20a%20row!%20Kuzmakong%20cut%2025%20+%209,%20green%20shot%2028%20points%20to%20kill%20the%20old%20master,%20Howard%20was%20expelled/35dc4900-179a-4f3b-9221-1fad9aab7f7d.gif" alt="Four in a row! Kuzmakong cut 25 + 9, green shot 28 points to kill the old master, Howard was expelled"><br>In the third quarter, green continued to score three points, leading the team to play a wave of 14-4 climax, and the difference was pulled to double digits. Behind the Lakers did not panic, Kuzma scored in a row, and Simmons also hit the basket response. In the middle of the three-point ball to stop the Lakers, the Lakers in the second half into a scoring shortage, only Kuzma barely support, and Milton led the team to continue to expand the gap, three quarters, the 76ers 89-71 lead the Lakers 18 points! Back in the fourth quarter, the Lakers went all out to fight back. Kuzma and Harrell scored five points in a row. After that, the 76ers called for a continuous stop. However, the Lakers played a 16-5 climax relying on the three-point rain of pop and Kuzma. Harris stopped bleeding at the critical moment, while Harrell attacked the basket, Kuzma broke through and continued to kill. At the end of the game, green shot three points, killing the suspense of the game, and the Lakers lost to Daniel Green.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/17/Four%20in%20a%20row!%20Kuzmakong%20cut%2025%20+%209,%20green%20shot%2028%20points%20to%20kill%20the%20old%20master,%20Howard%20was%20expelled/03187d90-72d8-45d9-904b-1015362e4fd9.gif" alt="Four in a row! Kuzmakong cut 25 + 9, green shot 28 points to kill the old master, Howard was expelled"><br>To be honest, the Lakers played really well today! Three people who have been in the center of trading rumors before: Harrell, Schroeder and Popper. No matter how much psychological pressure they have suffered before, at least today their attitude and fighting spirit are praiseworthy. Harrell’s strong attack, Popper’s ability to shoot, Schroeder constantly feeds Kuzma, Morris and Haler. Although there is no James and Davis, this Laker is in this wave In the process of losing in a row, people see hope, which is the most important thing. The Lakers are not afraid to lose, but they have to get something. In addition, Kuzma is now the absolute core of the Laker. In the fourth quarter, he made up a three-point deduction at a critical moment, including making fouls. He led the team to catch up with only three points short. Although the ball lost, the Laker players can leave the arena today with their heads held high!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/17/Four%20in%20a%20row!%20Kuzmakong%20cut%2025%20+%209,%20green%20shot%2028%20points%20to%20kill%20the%20old%20master,%20Howard%20was%20expelled/908b6ed2-0675-4b7b-b017-f998932a09be.gif" alt="Four in a row! Kuzmakong cut 25 + 9, green shot 28 points to kill the old master, Howard was expelled"><br>Enbid was injured, Bradley and puye were traded, Howard was expelled, and the 76ers had no center. The 76ers really hope to get Lori at the last moment of the window period, and their agents have told green that they are ready to leave the team, but in the end, the 76ers did not complete the deal. They don’t need too much adjustment and change in this team now. After getting George Hill from the bench, there is a veteran who has come down. Now they are enough to compete with the nets. With the deepening of the schedule, Denny green and little curry are getting better and better. Don’t forget that they still lack enbid. Of course, from an emotional point of view, I hope the 76ers will be eliminated in the first round of the playoffs, which will not affect us to watch the Eastern Conference semi-finals or the Eastern Conference finals.</p>
