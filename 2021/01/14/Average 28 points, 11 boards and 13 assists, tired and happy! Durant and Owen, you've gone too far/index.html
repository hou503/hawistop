Durant and Owen, you&#39;ve gone too far"><br>It’s a cause and effect cycle to see how bad harden’s performance is and how bad the Rockets are now. Harden is not sorry for the rocket, and the rocket has not failed harden. In the last game, the nets won again. Before the game, Nash said Durant had to rest for a few weeks. It’s like Durant and Davis are waiting to shine in the playoffs to see who has a long rest. In addition, Nash said Owen has a groin injury, the rest of the game, but does not affect the next game, straight white point said: rotation. It’s harden who leads the team alone, and harden who is father and mother alone. 42 minutes, 27 in 13, a total of 40 points, 10 rebounds, 15 assists, 2 steals, there are three details in the game, I feel inexplicably sad.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/14/Average%2028%20points,%2011%20boards%20and%2013%20assists,%20tired%20and%20happy!%20Durant%20and%20Owen,%20you've%20gone%20too%20far/723f4dd8-63cc-4ca6-8386-f9c198a3e611.gif" alt="Average 28 points, 11 boards and 13 assists, tired and happy! Durant and Owen, you&#39;ve gone too far"><br>With 4 minutes left in the fourth quarter, the net was 9 points ahead of the Pacers. At that time, the Pacers tried to fight back, and the rhythm was very fast. In a dead ball gap, harden directly signaled to Nash on the coach’s bench and quickly called for a pause. Nash immediately stopped without saying a word. Harden sat down on the chair near the baseline, gasping heavily, his eyes blurred, as if he was about to suffocate. With 1:31 left in the fourth quarter, the pacer’s free throw. Harden was originally standing on the left side of the free throw player. He signaled to the referee that he wanted to go to the right side. The referee nodded. Harden paced slowly and had another ten seconds to rest. At that moment, the referee, including the opponent, didn’t respond. Of course, they knew that harden was too tired. He just wanted to fight for more time to rest for himself.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/14/Average%2028%20points,%2011%20boards%20and%2013%20assists,%20tired%20and%20happy!%20Durant%20and%20Owen,%20you've%20gone%20too%20far/b5af8d70-39d0-4aec-a0fd-6713d2d291fc.gif" alt="Average 28 points, 11 boards and 13 assists, tired and happy! Durant and Owen, you&#39;ve gone too far"><br>In the middle of the fourth quarter, harden made a series of strong attacks, leading the team to make the difference bigger and bigger. In the interval of a penalty, Nash called harden over, indicating that he should play more aggressively (NASH revealed himself after the game), while harden’s whole coat was completely wet, brown and Harris’s shirt was clean, only harden! I finally understand what old Zhan said at the beginning. It’s normal to lose five or six pounds after a game, if you try your best. At the end of the game, Lowell threw the last ball, which was obviously off track. Harden’s teammates and opponents “tacit understanding” left the basket, and the ball fell into harden’s hands. It was this rebound that harden finally achieved triple doubles. The walkers were subdued by harden and completed harden’s battle of God.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/14/Average%2028%20points,%2011%20boards%20and%2013%20assists,%20tired%20and%20happy!%20Durant%20and%20Owen,%20you've%20gone%20too%20far/55f0af12-182e-4f2c-80a7-b665c642d84a.gif" alt="Average 28 points, 11 boards and 13 assists, tired and happy! Durant and Owen, you&#39;ve gone too far"><br>What records did harden break? The total score surpasses Peyton’s 33rd in history; the total assists surpass Billups’s 45th in history; the total number of career appearances is equal to Durant; 21 10 + assists in 27 games, the first person in the nets after the 12-13 season; 30 + 15 in the nets three times, the first in the history of the team; 40 + triple doubles in the 16th time, only next to Robertson in the history of NBA; 30 + 10 assists in six times in a single season, the most in the history of the nets In the history of NBA, he was the third player to win 40 + triple doubles in many teams, second only to Chamberlain, Jordan and Kobe Bryant; he led the team to complete 16 + reversals twice in a single season, the first in the history of the nets; he was the second player to win 40 + triple doubles in the history of the nets; he was the third player to win 40 + triple doubles in many teams in the history of NBA, second only to Chamberlain and weishao; he had 11 triple doubles in 27 games, only 1 short of the record of Kidd The data of 35 points and 15 assists is the only one in the history of the nets! 13 records belong to harden.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/14/Average%2028%20points,%2011%20boards%20and%2013%20assists,%20tired%20and%20happy!%20Durant%20and%20Owen,%20you've%20gone%20too%20far/776a598d-8641-4850-aaec-098dd7cf397f.gif" alt="Average 28 points, 11 boards and 13 assists, tired and happy! Durant and Owen, you&#39;ve gone too far"><br>Since March, harden has averaged 40.4 minutes, averaging 27.7 points + 11.3 rebounds + 12.8 assists + 1.7 steals + 1.2 blocks, with a real hit rate of 60.4% and a ball right utilization rate of 29.1%. Some fans will say, is harden that tired? Didn’t he feed his teammates bread? It should be easier than the Rockets to keep scoring, right? In fact, in the period of rockets, harden didn’t care about defense at all. He only participated in defense at specific moments, such as opposition joachi and strangling Downes. I believe the old fans were impressed. In most of the games, harden only needs to score on the offensive end, leaving the rest to Tucker, Paul, Ariza and Capella. And now they go to the end of the world!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/14/Average%2028%20points,%2011%20boards%20and%2013%20assists,%20tired%20and%20happy!%20Durant%20and%20Owen,%20you've%20gone%20too%20far/f8f7221f-f3b1-4825-a097-86efcbe02a45.gif" alt="Average 28 points, 11 boards and 13 assists, tired and happy! Durant and Owen, you&#39;ve gone too far"><br>To the net, harden really does not need to average 35 points, 40 points, but harden’s task in the defensive end is much heavier than before! Harden needs to go to the top defense position 4, he also needs to participate in the rotation defense, Jordan is not present, harden also needs to go to the basket with Jeff Green to protect the frame. In Nash’s words, people tend to ignore the defensive energy of harden because of his offensive strength. To put it bluntly, he who can do it will do more! Who let you harden to be able to connect the organization, but also in the low melee? Who made you harden for 40 minutes and never get hurt like iron man? There are only three players in the whole basketball net who can support harden on the defensive end (the defensive efficiency is above the average level of the team): Durant, who is not absent for a long time, is only Jeff Green, little Jordan and Clarkston, and Owen is not.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/14/Average%2028%20points,%2011%20boards%20and%2013%20assists,%20tired%20and%20happy!%20Durant%20and%20Owen,%20you've%20gone%20too%20far/3011322d-fd23-48b7-920d-ecac72871735.gif" alt="Average 28 points, 11 boards and 13 assists, tired and happy! Durant and Owen, you&#39;ve gone too far"><br>As a joke, Owen and Durant are going too far. Of course, I believe we all understand the decision made by the coaching staff. Durant came back from a big injury. In addition, in the first half of the match, before harden came, Durant played 35 minutes on the court. He really reached the limit of his body. Moreover, this time, he still had tendon problems. He was careless and had to take care of minor injuries. Including Owen, Owen suffered from shoulder injury in the past two seasons. In fact, the physical confrontation he encountered at the offensive end was more intense than that of harden, and his body was normal. Only harden and d’antony have witnessed how harden led the Rockets in the past three years. He and Nash have the confidence. Of course, how did the net win the championship trophy in the end? I remember that in the military medal, there was a heavy stroke from harden. I remember that when you were all injured, harden took the net to the first place in the East!</p>
