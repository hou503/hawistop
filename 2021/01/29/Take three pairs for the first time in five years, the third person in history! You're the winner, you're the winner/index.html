You&#39;re the winner, you&#39;re the winner"><br>The Rockets are the only team in NBA history that has won 20 + Games in a row but also suffered 20 losses in a row. In the 22 consecutive wins, there were Yao Ming, T-Mac, Scola, Alston, Landry and other old Rocket fans. When the Rockets lost 20 games in a row, they were replaced by wall, oradipo and Gordon. I’m sure that if Gordon has a chance to escape from Houston, he will also want to leave, but he can’t help it! Rockets finally won, 117-99 beat raptors, Rockets win as if the Chinese New Year in general, and even boarded the hot search, guess what wall said after the game?<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/29/Take%20three%20pairs%20for%20the%20first%20time%20in%20five%20years,%20the%20third%20person%20in%20history!%20You're%20the%20winner,%20you're%20the%20winner/bdd77ce8-4090-499b-af19-47e6d2a2c22a.gif" alt="Take three pairs for the first time in five years, the third person in history! You&#39;re the winner, you&#39;re the winner"><br>Wall: “we just play and compete. Everyone is involved in the game. We don’t have that spirit during the losing streak. We have to keep it up.” Speaking of Silas embracing himself after the game, wall said: “I told him that we finally won the game. Silas said he loved me, he appreciated my leadership, and we all respected him. We have a good relationship and communicate with each other a lot. It took him 20 years to become manager. I don’t want him to go through these difficulties As long as you can win, no matter how big the contradictions and difficulties are insignificant. It’s true that everyone has this hatred, but poor couples are sad. Now that you’re rich, you won’t have those bad things. But Wall secretly set a new record.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/29/Take%20three%20pairs%20for%20the%20first%20time%20in%20five%20years,%20the%20third%20person%20in%20history!%20You're%20the%20winner,%20you're%20the%20winner/9e53c6c0-cfd6-41c6-817d-594426e7921c.gif" alt="Take three pairs for the first time in five years, the third person in history! You&#39;re the winner, you&#39;re the winner"><br>In 36 minutes, he made 8 of 30 shots, including 1 of 7 three-point shots, with a total of 19 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists. This is the first time for wall to get three doubles in the past five years after playing 76 on March 18, 2016! But this is not the record that wall broke. Since the introduction of the three-point line into the NBA, in the last 35 years, only three people in the NBA have not scored more than 20 points in the case of more than 30 shots. The real shooting rate is even less than 45%. The first one is Gary Payton, the glove man in the 00-01 season, who scored 19 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists in 9 of 30. Second, big Wei Shao. On December 4, 19, when the Rockets played the Spurs, Wei Shao hit 7 goals in 30 times, 1 in 6 outside the three-point line, and also got 19 points. The third is wall. In other words, since the NBA set up the three-point line, wall is the player who shot more than 30 times, with the lowest real hit rate.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/29/Take%20three%20pairs%20for%20the%20first%20time%20in%20five%20years,%20the%20third%20person%20in%20history!%20You're%20the%20winner,%20you're%20the%20winner/c9d4d262-b997-4766-b1eb-b20aac3eddfd.gif" alt="Take three pairs for the first time in five years, the third person in history! You&#39;re the winner, you&#39;re the winner"><br>How did the Rockets win the Raptors? It can be said that in addition to wall, other role players play very well, brown 10 in 7, wood 15 in 8, Tate 9 in 8, house 5 in 4, even the bench than the opponent took 10 points, the Rockets rare multi-point outbreak, full bloom! That’s even simpler. If wall throws his strong shots from the outside line 10 times to Tate, house and brown, maybe the Rockets can win by 30 points. Who doesn’t eat dumplings for the Chinese new year? What’s more, the Raptors are on the verge of collapse now! I think, the role of the Rockets players must not look down, the last game lost thunder, coach Silas in the press conference, 15 seconds silence, then said: I actually arranged the last is a pick and roll tactics! Yes, wood’s pick and roll for oradipo has formed a projection space, but Wall didn’t look at it. He hit the iron and the game was over.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/29/Take%20three%20pairs%20for%20the%20first%20time%20in%20five%20years,%20the%20third%20person%20in%20history!%20You're%20the%20winner,%20you're%20the%20winner/ce3f3951-043f-49e7-bd06-ca8a4153174b.gif" alt="Take three pairs for the first time in five years, the third person in history! You&#39;re the winner, you&#39;re the winner"><br>In fact, wall is not easy. He entered the league as the number one player. After a few years of playing, he suffered from stress fracture of the left knee cap. In the following 15 years, he suffered from fracture of his left wrist in the eastern semi-finals. In 16 years, he underwent surgery on his left knee. In 18 years, he underwent surgery on his left knee again. In fact, when wall first entered the league, he was able to see the shadow of a superstar in both passing and holding the ball. But with continuous knee and Achilles tendon injuries, he really could not recover to the peak level. And his personal projection ability is not as good as Wei Shao!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/29/Take%20three%20pairs%20for%20the%20first%20time%20in%20five%20years,%20the%20third%20person%20in%20history!%20You're%20the%20winner,%20you're%20the%20winner/0cc8f9dd-e1e7-45d1-aa5b-ad14193ef651.gif" alt="Take three pairs for the first time in five years, the third person in history!

<p><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/29/Take%20three%20pairs%20for%20the%20first%20time%20in%20five%20years,%20the%20third%20person%20in%20history!%20You're%20the%20winner,%20you're%20the%20winner/c4f86ce7-3a68-4368-93de-23c21f0a92bb.gif" alt="Take three pairs for the first time in five years, the third person in history! You&#39;re the winner, you&#39;re the winner"><br>Congratulations, wall. You can rest assured that you will be the leader of the team. With wall’s current value and his remaining three years (including this year’s) salary of $130 million, if the Rockets want to send him away, they have to supplement at least two first round signings, and it also depends on whether a team has enough salary space to eat him. Who wants a player with a 20 + 6 average and a salary of more than 40 million? Rockets in the bad period, of course, will not be silly enough to catch the first round to send off wall. In the days with wall, the Rockets will always be rotten, because the upper limit of the team’s boss is here. Maybe in the 22-23 season, the last year of wall’s contract, the Rockets will have a chance to dump him. But at that time, he was 33 years old. Although he didn’t get too many honors in his career, he at least made a lot of money. This is also a life winner!</p>
