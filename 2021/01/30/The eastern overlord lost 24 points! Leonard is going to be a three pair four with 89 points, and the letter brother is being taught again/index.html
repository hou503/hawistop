        <p>Beijing time on March 30, the NBA regular season continues, the Clippers take home against the bucks. Before that, the Clippers ranked third in the West with a record of 31-16, and the Bucks ranked third in the East with a record of 29-16. The Bucks also took four main players off in the last game for this competition. While George on the clipper side was warming up before the race, he suddenly felt sore in his right foot and withdrew temporarily! Leonard leads the team to fight against the bucks. The Bucks have 12 points in the first quarter and fall to one side in the last three quarters. The clippers have the absolute advantage! The final score was set at 129-105, with the Clippers beating the bucks at home. Clippers ushered in six wins in a row, Bucks suffered three losses in a row!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/30/The%20eastern%20overlord%20lost%2024%20points!%20Leonard%20is%20going%20to%20be%20a%20three%20pair%20four%20with%2089%20points,%20and%20the%20letter%20brother%20is%20being%20taught%20again/2fcdb03e-ecbf-44e3-8498-6ee787171043.gif" alt="The eastern overlord lost 24 points!

On the Clippers side, Leonard has 23 points, 9 rebounds, 8 assists and 2 steals, young Morris has 25 points, 5 rebounds and 3 assists, Kennard has 21 points, 5 rebounds and 2 assists, Reggie has 20 points, 2 rebounds and 3 assists, Mann has 14 points, 6 rebounds and 6 assists, bartum has 8 points, 7 rebounds and Patterson has 9 points.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/30/The%20eastern%20overlord%20lost%2024%20points!%20Leonard%20is%20going%20to%20be%20a%20three%20pair%20four%20with%2089%20points,%20and%20the%20letter%20brother%20is%20being%20taught%20again/9d935e39-246c-454e-809e-1ba4705f76ed.gif" alt="The eastern overlord lost 24 points! Leonard is going to be a three pair four with 89 points, and the letter brother is being taught again"><br>At the beginning, the letter brother made a strong attack under the basket, shot in the middle and three-point shot to win the team’s first seven points, while the Clippers relied on Leonard and Reggie to grasp the score, Reggie’s three-point ball in the middle and Carlos’ counter attack layup to help the Clippers open the scoring gap. Unexpectedly, the second half of the sudden change, the Clippers attack efficiency decline, and the letter brother joint huoledi and Connaughton sent a wave of 15-3 climax, strong open the difference! Section one bucks 38-26 clipper. Back in the second quarter, the Bucks only got 2 points in the first 4 minutes, the Clippers quickly counterattacked, Mann’s inward and outward shot got 6 points, little Morris got 5 points, after a wave of 15-4 draw, little Morris and Leonard led the team to easily surpass. In the second half, the Bucks relied on huoledi and Middleton not to let the difference open, the two sides fell into a stalemate, Batum scored three points at the end of the festival, and the Clippers 57-55 bucks played at half time.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/30/The%20eastern%20overlord%20lost%2024%20points!%20Leonard%20is%20going%20to%20be%20a%20three%20pair%20four%20with%2089%20points,%20and%20the%20letter%20brother%20is%20being%20taught%20again/536a3d76-efd0-4688-8a3f-eecca26badae.gif" alt="The eastern overlord lost 24 points! Leonard is going to be a three pair four with 89 points, and the letter brother is being taught again"><br>In the third quarter, the letter Corinthians got 4 points. In the first 4 minutes of bucks, only the letter brother scored. The Clippers had more points to blossom. The small card had a series of strong attacks. Reggie and little Morris fired from the outside line. After the Clippers opened the scoring gap, the two teams in the middle of the game began to attack. The letter brother and Middleton were all shot in vain, while Reggie and Leonard were strong in the lead. Batum and Mann finished 2 + 1 in the second half, and the Clippers took a double-digit lead. At the end of the festival, the Bucks rely on Forbes to stop bleeding by three points. Patterson responds by three points. After three quarters, the Clippers 96-86 bucks. Back in the fourth quarter, brother Letterman led the team to continue to chase points. In the middle, brother Letterman and big Lopez were only six points short. At the critical moment, Kennard suddenly burst out, scoring four three-point goals in a row, directly killing the suspense of the game. Brother Letterman was still making damage under the impact basket, but he could not affect the overall situation. Finally, the Bucks threw the ball to admit the defeat. The Clippers beat the bucks at home and made a 6-game winning streak to catch up with the sun ！<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/30/The%20eastern%20overlord%20lost%2024%20points!%20Leonard%20is%20going%20to%20be%20a%20three%20pair%20four%20with%2089%20points,%20and%20the%20letter%20brother%20is%20being%20taught%20again/4ef55486-1663-43b5-8d30-fe35b311951b.gif" alt="The eastern overlord lost 24 points! Leonard is going to be a three pair four with 89 points, and the letter brother is being taught again"><br>I tried my best! Today, the letter brother 34 minutes, 21 in 10, got 32 points, 6 rebounds, 3 assists, but lost 31 points! As a matter of fact, the tactics tylenlu arranged for the Clippers are basically the same as those encountered by the letter elder brother in the past few years. Let the letter elder brother break through, give the letter elder brother physical confrontation, and cut off the practice of the letter elder brother and his teammates. This kind of playing method will make other bucks players hard to play, and the letter elder brother may not be able to get 2 points when he encounters all kinds of resistance in each round of attack, and the Clippers will score 19 points in the whole court The gap is obvious. But Middleton has not achieved anything. Leonard has been keeping a close eye on him. Huoledi is in good condition, but the ball power is limited. The bucks are really embarrassed now. After the game, the gap between the bucks and the nets widened to 2 wins. The nets now have no pursuers, and there is only one 76er in front.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/30/The%20eastern%20overlord%20lost%2024%20points!%20Leonard%20is%20going%20to%20be%20a%20three%20pair%20four%20with%2089%20points,%20and%20the%20letter%20brother%20is%20being%20taught%20again/78e717a3-567e-421e-8766-3108ff2eb93f.gif" alt="The eastern overlord lost 24 points! Leonard is going to be a three pair four with 89 points, and the letter brother is being taught again"><br>Since sending away Dewey, Mann and Kennard take turns breaking out! In fact, Mann has great impact, has three-point range, is young and dares to fight. He also likes to feed zubaz and Batum. He is really a young player who can be trained. And Leonard today all focus on the defensive end, in addition to sending the team’s highest eight assists, really revitalized the team, when the Bucks attack Leonard, young Morris, Kennard and Reggie are all big vacancies, three people together into 13 three-point ball, clippers four strong to get 89 points, this is the letter brother and Leonard’s gap. Basketball, after all, is a game of five people, not a fight of one person, unless you are harden.</p>
