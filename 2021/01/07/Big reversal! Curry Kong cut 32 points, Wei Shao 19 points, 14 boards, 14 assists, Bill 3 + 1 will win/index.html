        <p>Beijing time on April 10, the NBA regular season continues, warriors at home against the wizard. Before that, the wizard’s record was 18-32, ranking 13th in the East, while the warrior’s record was 24-27, ranking 10th in the West. This game both sides send the main force to fight, the game twists and turns, the wizard in the vast majority of the time to take the initiative, and the warriors in the last moment to level the difference. At the critical moment, Bill made two mistakes (and Wiggins and curry scored 6 points). But in the last 6 seconds, Bill finished 3 + 1, and then Bill made two free throws to win! The final score was fixed at 107-110, and the warriors lost at home to the wizards, who won two games in a row.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/07/Big%20reversal!%20Curry%20Kong%20cut%2032%20points,%20Wei%20Shao%2019%20points,%2014%20boards,%2014%20assists,%20Bill%203%20+%201%20will%20win/56e5f9de-dc8f-47f0-82af-08058f034521.gif" alt="Big reversal!

Curry Kong cut 32 points, Wei Shao 19 points, 14 boards, 14 assists, Bill 3 + 1 will win"><br>At the beginning of the game, the wizard took the lead to enter the state, eight villages even got 6 points, warriors rely on curry to lay up to stop bleeding, ubre chased three points. In the middle of the game, eight villages and Ryan were able to attack the frame in succession. Wiseman ate the cake, and KULI led the team to level the difference. In the second half of the game, the warriors’ attack stagnated. Ryan and bakumura continued to attack the basket. Little Lopez hooked and beltans scored three points. At the end of the first quarter, the Wizards 32-23. In the second quarter, after Damian Lee stopped bleeding by three points, little Lopez and netto took points continuously, with the difference reaching double digits. Damian Lee and ubre responded to two three points at the critical moment. The middle of the small Lopez constantly attack the basket, Wiggins and ubre singles response. At the end of the festival, bill and Wei Shao hit the basket, curry even took 5 points to stop bleeding, after half-time, the wizard was 57-50 ahead of the warriors.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/07/Big%20reversal!%20Curry%20Kong%20cut%2032%20points,%20Wei%20Shao%2019%20points,%2014%20boards,%2014%20assists,%20Bill%203%20+%201%20will%20win/efbd53a8-3777-40d5-9ac2-5bf0f34d8a9f.gif" alt="Big reversal! Curry Kong cut 32 points, Wei Shao 19 points, 14 boards, 14 assists, Bill 3 + 1 will win"><br>Back in the third quarter, Ryan and Wiseman hit each other in the inner line, weishao jump shot scored, curry responded with three points. Ryan and weishao play a small climax, curry in three points, ubre out of the sudden shot cut 9 points, the warriors with a wave of 17-4 anti super wizard. In the second half, bill and weishao opened fire, and bertans also scored three points. The Wizards responded to a wave of 11-1 climax. After three quarters, the Wizards 85-79 led the warriors by 6 points. Back in the fourth quarter, the warriors relied on bezmore and Wiseman to level the score. After weishao stopped bleeding, Damian Lee and Wiseman reversed the lead again. In the middle, Wiggins and Wiseman helped the warriors get points, but bamura and little Lopez were all in vain. At the decisive moment, Wiggins slammed the dunk, curry also hit the layup, and then curry made two fouls. In the last six seconds, Bill scored three points, made Wiggins foul and hit the penalty. Damian Lee was robbed by afdiya, curry scored three points, and the wizard narrowly beat the warriors with three points!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/07/Big%20reversal!%20Curry%20Kong%20cut%2032%20points,%20Wei%20Shao%2019%20points,%2014%20boards,%2014%20assists,%20Bill%203%20+%201%20will%20win/c58dd0b1-1d23-4dd0-9f4a-166bb7acef10.gif" alt="Big reversal! Curry Kong cut 32 points, Wei Shao 19 points, 14 boards, 14 assists, Bill 3 + 1 will win"><br>With 32 points in the game, curry’s score in the regular season surpassed Marion and Magic Johnson to 81st in NBA history. In front of him is Howell, and curry is 43 points behind him. To be honest, today Curry’s performance is relatively average, with 25 shots hitting 11 goals. Willis and Smith, including Matthews, have never given up their restrictions on curry. It’s difficult for curry to find space for his shots. In the last six seconds of the game, Cole let green catch the ball and then passed it to Damian Lee. Damian Lee was not ready to attack the box and was directly cut off by afdiya, so the warriors lost the game. The positive and negative value of Curie - 16 is the lowest in the whole game.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/07/Big%20reversal!%20Curry%20Kong%20cut%2032%20points,%20Wei%20Shao%2019%20points,%2014%20boards,%2014%20assists,%20Bill%203%20+%201%20will%20win/cd372634-eb4b-4911-971b-31ff4be7439c.gif" alt="Big reversal! Curry Kong cut 32 points, Wei Shao 19 points, 14 boards, 14 assists, Bill 3 + 1 will win"><br>Williams is 8 in 17, with 19 points, 14 rebounds and 14 assists. This is his 21st triple double this season and his 167th triple double in his career. He is still 14 short of Robertson. Williams is expected to surpass Robertson this season. In addition, Wei Shao is also constantly breaking the three double record of the history of the wizards and the three double record of a single season. In today’s game, Bill lost and bill won. Weishao, including bamura, little Lopez and Ryan, played very well. They all scored more than 15 points. It depends on Bill’s ability at the critical moment. Bill made two mistakes at the last moment, which nearly ruined the game, but fortunately, the last 3 + 1 turned the tide.</p>
