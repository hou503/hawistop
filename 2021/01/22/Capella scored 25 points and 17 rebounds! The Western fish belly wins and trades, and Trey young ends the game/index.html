        <p>On March 25, Beijing time, the NBA regular season continued, with the king playing at home against the Hawks. Before that, the eagles were 22-21, ranking fifth in the East, while the kings were 18-25, ranking 13th in the West. Since new coach McMillan took office, the eagles have won 8 of 9 games, and the momentum is fierce. Facing the king with average strength, they are not easy to play! Capella broke out with high efficiency, but his participation was very low. At the last moment, Gallinari missed the goal. The king defeated the eagles 110-108 at home, and the king won two games in a row. The eagles suffered two losses in a row.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/22/Capella%20scored%2025%20points%20and%2017%20rebounds!%20The%20Western%20fish%20belly%20wins%20and%20trades,%20and%20Trey%20young%20ends%20the%20game/e011a062-39b4-4244-ac66-51ae16f1afd3.gif" alt="Capella scored 25 points and 17 rebounds! The Western fish belly wins and trades, and Trey young ends the game"><br>Data, on the Hawks side, Capella has 25 points and 17 rebounds, Trey young has 29 points and 9 assists, Bogdan has 20 points and 4 rebounds, Gary Nari has 12 points, Schulte has 10 points and Collins has 10 points and 8 rebounds. On the king’s side, fox has 37 points, Halliburton has 17 points, 5 rebounds and 7 assists, Holmes has 16 points, 8 rebounds and Hilde has 14 points.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/22/Capella%20scored%2025%20points%20and%2017%20rebounds!%20The%20Western%20fish%20belly%20wins%20and%20trades,%20and%20Trey%20young%20ends%20the%20game/ce579dcc-ba58-4733-a5d8-796d49893bec.gif" alt="Capella scored 25 points and 17 rebounds! The Western fish belly wins and trades, and Trey young ends the game"><br>At the beginning of the game, schulter made a jump shot, Fox and Hilde responded to three points in a row. In the middle of the game, Capella and Collins made 7-0 rebounds and ate cakes to complete the counter super, while Hilde and fox continued to break out and hit in a row. In the last two minutes, the king fell into scoring shortage. The eagles scored 6 points under the leadership of Bogdan. After the first quarter, the king was 29-27. In the second quarter, Gallinari helped the Hawks to level the difference. After that, the king continued to work hard, Holmes’ smash, fox’s counterattack, and the Hawks kept on holding the score but couldn’t surpass. In the middle of the game, fox took 5 points to lead the team to open the gap again. At the end of the game, Capella and Collins made a series of smashes. At the end of the half-time, the two sides drew 57 points!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/22/Capella%20scored%2025%20points%20and%2017%20rebounds!%20The%20Western%20fish%20belly%20wins%20and%20trades,%20and%20Trey%20young%20ends%20the%20game/6546dd95-fc63-4d6c-9bee-47c3a065e2c1.gif" alt="Capella scored 25 points and 17 rebounds! The Western fish belly wins and trades, and Trey young ends the game"><br>The third quarter back, Trey Young’s throw to help the Hawks over, and since then the king rely on Halliburton and Holmes even get 6 points to stop the Hawks. Halliburton and Hilde continued to rain three points in the middle of the game, while the hawks were completely silent. After Trey Young made two free throws, the Hawks continued to strike iron on the outside line, but Trey young, schulter and Gallinari didn’t feel anything. The Hawks didn’t score in the last five minutes, while the king relied on Fox to lead the team to an 11-0 climax. After three quarters, the king was 85-74. In the fourth quarter, the Hawks took 9 points to narrow the difference. Holmes slammed the ball to stop bleeding. Capella helped the Hawks to level the difference in the middle of the game. At the decisive moment, the king hit the basket continuously, and Bogdan and Trey young scored two three-point balls to help the team level the difference. In the last 36 seconds, Harry Burton made two free throws, Trey Yang missed, fox made a mistake, Trey Yang didn’t miss the penalty area Direct layup, seems to be waiting for fouls, direct fox shot out of bounds! In the last 1.3 seconds, Gallinari scored two points and the Hawks lost!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/22/Capella%20scored%2025%20points%20and%2017%20rebounds!%20The%20Western%20fish%20belly%20wins%20and%20trades,%20and%20Trey%20young%20ends%20the%20game/4859f433-3d96-45ac-b1f8-bd908de6cec7.gif" alt="Capella scored 25 points and 17 rebounds! The Western fish belly wins and trades, and Trey young ends the game"><br>Capella is the eagles’ best player. 31 minutes, 10 in 12, a total of 25 points, 17 rebounds, 2 assists, 1 steals, 1 blocks, including 9 front court rebounds, the highest positive and negative value of the team is + 8! In fact, most of Capella’s scores come from his second rebounding. He doesn’t really get many assists from his teammates. Trey young likes to make fouls with the ball, Collins plays singles with the ball, schulter is a fixed-point shooter, and Snell doesn’t have much sense of existence. It’s really not easy for Capella to get this kind of data under this system. There is a suspicion of being buried! But there is no doubt that Capella is now the league’s top center. And Trey young has now formed a very bad habit, even if the sky basket, waiting for the opponent to foul, trying to win the free throw, which is a little difficult to understand.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/22/Capella%20scored%2025%20points%20and%2017%20rebounds!%20The%20Western%20fish%20belly%20wins%20and%20trades,%20and%20Trey%20young%20ends%20the%20game/432ee0d8-d4d0-4dec-9d7b-61d187c12ebb.gif" alt="Capella scored 25 points and 17 rebounds! The Western fish belly wins and trades, and Trey young ends the game"><br>Now the competition in the west is very complicated. In fact, the 13th king is also likely to compete in the playoffs. They are only 3.5 games behind the 10th Grizzlies. Their talent is useless. Fox, Halliburton, Bagley and others are plastic talents, but Wharton does not unite them as a whole. Of course, the king is also broken, they are not willing to fire Wharton, do not want to pay high liquidated damages, so just muddle along. There are only two teams in the west, the rockets and the Timberwolves, whose goal is this summer’s draft. And after this game, the king and the pistons completed the transaction, the king sent Joseph and two second round signings, from the pistons in exchange for dranlette, it seems that the king also wants to fight a playoff!</p>
