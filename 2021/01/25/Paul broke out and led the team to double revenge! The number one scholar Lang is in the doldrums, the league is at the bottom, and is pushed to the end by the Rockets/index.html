        <p>On March 20, Beijing time, the NBA regular season continued, with the sun at home against the Timberwolves. Before the game, the Suns had a record of 26-13, ranking third in the western region, while the Timberwolves had a record of 10-31, ranking first from the bottom in the western region. In the last game, the Timberwolves double champion smashed 83 points to reverse the Suns, leading to the Suns being overtaken by the Lakers. In the second back-to-back game, the sun didn’t give the Timberwolves another chance. Paul stepped forward and led the team to double, while Edwards was targeted by Paul today, and his performance was terrible! 113-101, the sun easily beat the Timberwolves, continue to rank third in the west, and the Timberwolves also slightly opened the gap with the Rockets.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/25/Paul%20broke%20out%20and%20led%20the%20team%20to%20double%20revenge!%20The%20number%20one%20scholar%20Lang%20is%20in%20the%20doldrums,%20the%20league%20is%20at%20the%20bottom,%20and%20is%20pushed%20to%20the%20end%20by%20the%20Rockets/15a83d88-5be0-47c4-9f59-80bbca22dff1.gif" alt="Paul broke out and led the team to double revenge! The number one scholar Lang is in the doldrums, the league is at the bottom, and is pushed to the end by the Rockets"><br>Data, on the Suns side, Paul has 20 points and 9 assists, Booker has 16 points and 7 rebounds and 5 assists, bridges has 17 points and 6 rebounds and 3 assists and 3 steals, Claude has 10 points and 4 rebounds, Galloway has 14 points, nedell has 10 points, Penn has 11 points and 5 rebounds and 4 assists. On the Timberwolves side, Downes has 24 points and 9 rebounds, Edwards has 11 points and 10 rebounds and 6 assists, Rubio has 21 points and 5 rebounds and 10 assists, and Norwell has 14 points.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/25/Paul%20broke%20out%20and%20led%20the%20team%20to%20double%20revenge!%20The%20number%20one%20scholar%20Lang%20is%20in%20the%20doldrums,%20the%20league%20is%20at%20the%20bottom,%20and%20is%20pushed%20to%20the%20end%20by%20the%20Rockets/3d4dfb30-2db2-4df0-b8fa-1f86c34586df.gif" alt="Paul broke out and led the team to double revenge! The number one scholar Lang is in the doldrums, the league is at the bottom, and is pushed to the end by the Rockets"><br>In the first quarter, Daniels helped the Timberwolves break the deadlock, and Aton made a strong attack under the basket. After bridges scored three points, Downes made a breakthrough to complete the 2 + 1 response. In the middle, Booker and Aton bloom inside and outside, while Downes continues to attack the basket. In the second half, Downes and Claude fight for three points. At the end, the Suns rely on nedel and Penn to open the difference. In the first quarter, the Suns are 34-29 and the Timberwolves are 34-29. In the second quarter, Galloway scored three points, nedel slammed the button, and the difference between the two figures was widened, Edwards finally scored. Edwards and downslian scored 8 points in the middle, and the Suns coach was expelled. After Galloway stopped bleeding with three points, Paul and Booker led the team to stabilize their morale. At the end of the half-time, the Suns had a 64-54 lead over the Timberwolves by 10 points.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/25/Paul%20broke%20out%20and%20led%20the%20team%20to%20double%20revenge!%20The%20number%20one%20scholar%20Lang%20is%20in%20the%20doldrums,%20the%20league%20is%20at%20the%20bottom,%20and%20is%20pushed%20to%20the%20end%20by%20the%20Rockets/cecb3313-fcf4-49da-8b79-6e548b919d1c.gif" alt="Paul broke out and led the team to double revenge! The number one scholar Lang is in the doldrums, the league is at the bottom, and is pushed to the end by the Rockets"><br>The third quarter back, the sun attack power failure, the Timberwolves rely on Oakey and Edwards even get 5 points, after Rubio outside line hit three points, Downes and Edwards icing on the cake, a wave of 15-0 climax after the Timberwolves completed the anti super. At the critical moment, Paul hit in a row, and then made a three-point foul. Paul led the team to wipe out the difference again with bridges and Claude. At the end of the festival, Penn stepped forward and got 5 points in a row. After three quarters, the sun was 83-78 ahead of Timberwolves by 5 points. Back in the fourth quarter, Galloway and Norwell scored three points against each other. After that, the Timberwolves fell into a scoring shortage. Bridges led the team to play an 8-0 climax. Paul and Gomez scored three points against each other in the middle of the game. Claude’s 3 + 1 and Paul’s middle distance completely killed the suspense of the game at the decisive moment, and the Timberwolves accepted the defeat.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/25/Paul%20broke%20out%20and%20led%20the%20team%20to%20double%20revenge!%20The%20number%20one%20scholar%20Lang%20is%20in%20the%20doldrums,%20the%20league%20is%20at%20the%20bottom,%20and%20is%20pushed%20to%20the%20end%20by%20the%20Rockets/2d1e0fe1-597d-4228-b814-b7124534c917.gif" alt="Paul broke out and led the team to double revenge! The number one scholar Lang is in the doldrums, the league is at the bottom, and is pushed to the end by the Rockets"><br>The Suns are really hard today. In the middle of the second quarter of the game, Suns coach Monty Williams was expelled because he complained that the referee had two consecutive technical offenses. Paul only wanted to create scoring opportunities for bridges, Booker and nedell in the whole first half. The Suns didn’t take too much initiative, even if they successfully limited Edwards on the defensive end. In the third quarter, Paul led the team alone to wipe out the equaliser is particularly critical. Paul’s offensive efficiency with the ball is relatively high, but this is not the way he likes. The Suns need to adjust their hand as soon as possible.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/25/Paul%20broke%20out%20and%20led%20the%20team%20to%20double%20revenge!%20The%20number%20one%20scholar%20Lang%20is%20in%20the%20doldrums,%20the%20league%20is%20at%20the%20bottom,%20and%20is%20pushed%20to%20the%20end%20by%20the%20Rockets/e4069e32-41ed-4c1b-a154-66873d8bb447.gif" alt="Paul broke out and led the team to double revenge! The number one scholar Lang is in the doldrums, the league is at the bottom, and is pushed to the end by the Rockets"><br>The Rockets suffered 19 consecutive losses. Before this game, the Rockets had a record of 11-29, and only Timberwolves had a worse record than the Rockets in the whole league. And the Rockets are only 1.5 games ahead of the Timberwolves. If the Rockets lose like this, they won’t have to wait until the end of the month, and the Rockets will fall to the bottom of the league. Timberwolves have lost 7 of their last 10 games, which has been overtaken by the Rockets. The last three in the league this season have basically locked in the Rockets, Timberwolves and pistons. Let’s see who can win the number one draw, but it may not be useful to get the number one draw, such as Timberwolves this season.</p>
