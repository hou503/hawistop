Don&#39;t blame the thick eyebrows, don&#39;t blame the management, it&#39;s all Lao Zhan&#39;s fault"><br>James right foot high ankle sprain, for James, is a blessing, for the Lakers, is a sad thing. In the game with the eagles, Jen fell to the ground in the fight with Solomon hill, and his right ankle was obviously everted. At that moment, James fell to the ground in pain. In Kuzma’s words, he had never seen James angry and roaring like today! James took a break, hit a three-point goal after returning to the court, and then returned to the dressing room. He knew that his right foot couldn’t hold it. The good news is that after X-ray examination, there is no obvious structural damage. The bad news is that this ankle sprain usually takes 6-8 weeks to recover. If it’s really two months before the return of the game, I’m afraid the playoffs of the Lakers will start from the playoffs.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/23/Goodbye%20MVP,%20goodbye%20champion!%20Don't%20blame%20the%20thick%20eyebrows,%20don't%20blame%20the%20management,%20it's%20all%20Lao%20Zhan's%20fault/75bd40d3-a012-464c-9f5c-5ce176573fc2.gif" alt="Goodbye MVP, goodbye champion! Don&#39;t blame the thick eyebrows, don&#39;t blame the management, it&#39;s all Lao Zhan&#39;s fault"><br>You can imagine how bad the Lakers are without James! In James’s career, he missed the game, the team’s total record of 34-69, less than a third of the winning rate! In the absence of James this season, the offensive efficiency of the Lakers was 103.7, lower than that of the Cavaliers, who are the worst in the league. While the Lakers have James without Davis, the offensive efficiency is 119.8, compared with the overall efficiency of 112.8, there is still + 7 value-added. This is very interesting, Davis can truce, as long as the old Jen with a Schroeder, can share the ball right, the Lakers can also seize the top three in the west, this is James’s ability. But without James, what is the level of this Laker? At most, it is the level of magic and knight.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/23/Goodbye%20MVP,%20goodbye%20champion!%20Don't%20blame%20the%20thick%20eyebrows,%20don't%20blame%20the%20management,%20it's%20all%20Lao%20Zhan's%20fault/d2026a37-81b7-4094-a104-2c608c58c7ff.gif" alt="Goodbye MVP, goodbye champion! Don&#39;t blame the thick eyebrows, don&#39;t blame the management, it&#39;s all Lao Zhan&#39;s fault"><br>After learning about his injury, James expressed his attitude through the social platform: “nothing makes me more angry and sad than not being able to be with my teammates. I am physically and mentally tired now. I know the road to recovery starts now and I will come back as soon as possible as if I have never left. “ In the past 10 years, James suffered from this injury, the average absence of 10 games, but this year is not the same. In the past 10 games can play more than 3 weeks or even 4 weeks, this year, 2 days a game, the pace is too fast! Assuming that Jens can return as soon as four weeks, the Lakers will play 16 games in the next 29 days. The remaining opponents in March are the Suns, pelicans, 76ers, Cavaliers and magic. I don’t know how to win the Cavaliers without James. The last time the Lakers won the Cavaliers, James scored 46 points, and finally the Lakers only won 8 points.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/23/Goodbye%20MVP,%20goodbye%20champion!%20Don't%20blame%20the%20thick%20eyebrows,%20don't%20blame%20the%20management,%20it's%20all%20Lao%20Zhan's%20fault/edb4f2df-375b-4613-8959-4e69f082877d.gif" alt="Goodbye MVP, goodbye champion! Don&#39;t blame the thick eyebrows, don&#39;t blame the management, it&#39;s all Lao Zhan&#39;s fault"><br>For James, the injury is a blessing in misfortune! When the Lakers lost four in a row, Vogel said that the coaching staff had long wanted James to carry out load management, James refused! In his own words, he is not tired, tired is just subconscious retreat and cowardice. From the beginning of the new season to now, James has played 41 games in 86 days, with an average of 34 minutes per game. For the 36 year old Zhan, he can’t talk about the limit, but it’s almost the same. But at the beginning of the new season, Zhan didn’t say that. When he was interviewed by his good friend AoXiong, he said that he hoped Davis would take more responsibility in the new season, and he hoped that he could take over himself. This season is to pave the way for Davis. James where can think of the season has not played half, Davis first throw a mess to himself, and then go to rest assured?<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/23/Goodbye%20MVP,%20goodbye%20champion!%20Don't%20blame%20the%20thick%20eyebrows,%20don't%20blame%20the%20management,%20it's%20all%20Lao%20Zhan's%20fault/510c1722-7a33-4c92-a9ef-07e5984ff92a.gif" alt="Goodbye MVP, goodbye champion! Don&#39;t blame the thick eyebrows, don&#39;t blame the management, it&#39;s all Lao Zhan&#39;s fault"><br>We always like to set strict standards for James. Leading the team to win is the most basic condition. Secondly, the data should be good-looking and the efficiency should be maintained at a very high level. If there is a little dissatisfaction, someone will blame James for his poor ability in leading the team. Without Davis’ thigh, he can’t play by himself. He relies on the role player’s play to win and so on. But no one realizes that it’s James’ 18th season in the league. 99% of the players who joined the league in the same year have retired to live their lives and spend their lives in front of their wives and children. Meanwhile, James can send 25 + 8 + 8 data per game, dominate the MVP list for a long time, and compete with Letterman, Jokic and enby, who are more than 10 years younger than him German competition for MVP, but also with the body of steel refused to load management, carrying the Lakers forward. He’s not Superman. He’s tired, of course.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/23/Goodbye%20MVP,%20goodbye%20champion!%20Don't%20blame%20the%20thick%20eyebrows,%20don't%20blame%20the%20management,%20it's%20all%20Lao%20Zhan's%20fault/f6589f1b-d556-4656-8436-192c908dfaf2.gif" alt="Goodbye MVP, goodbye champion! Don&#39;t blame the thick eyebrows, don&#39;t blame the management, it&#39;s all Lao Zhan&#39;s fault"><br>Who is to blame? Does Davis, who blames the glass man’s attributes, fail to live up to old Zhan’s expectations and instructions? Blame the Laker management off-season easy to let go of the most outstanding outside defense green, Bradley, keep pop this season has been sleepwalking? Blame the Laker to kick out McKee and Howard directly, and then sign little Gasol. Now it’s a burden? In fact, when the Lakers won the championship last year, every role player has a very strong contribution and distinctive personal characteristics, which is really indispensable. Without Rondo in the playoffs, Jen really can’t stand it. There’s no Howard in the West. Maybe the Lakers have to lose three layers if they want to get to the finals. Including Denny green, who can play the sweeper on the three-point line, who can limit the opponent’s arrow character?<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/23/Goodbye%20MVP,%20goodbye%20champion!%20Don't%20blame%20the%20thick%20eyebrows,%20don't%20blame%20the%20management,%20it's%20all%20Lao%20Zhan's%20fault/bf2b3fd4-3349-4575-bc53-cb866c177089.gif" alt="Goodbye MVP, goodbye champion! Don&#39;t blame the thick eyebrows, don&#39;t blame the management, it&#39;s all Lao Zhan&#39;s fault"><br>Blame James! Who let you always so strong, let the Lakers mistakenly think have you and Davis, is equal to get the championship. The fault of the Lakers is that they broke their bones and muscles after winning the championship. Except for the skeleton of the house, there is nothing left. Dense schedule, but also to re run in, there are cracks in the skeleton, James can not tired? Injured, but is a good thing, peace of mind to recuperate, look at the lack of Jamie’s Laker in the end is what quality, look at Davis in the end how long to rest. Don’t be surprised if the Lakers don’t win the championship this year. The management of the Los Angeles team takes great credit.</p>
