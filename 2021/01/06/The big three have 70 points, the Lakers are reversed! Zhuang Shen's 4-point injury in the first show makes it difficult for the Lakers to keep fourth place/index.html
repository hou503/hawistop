        <p>On April 1, Beijing time, the NBA regular season continued, with the Lakers playing at home against the bucks. The Bucks were 29-17, third in the East, and the Lakers were 30-17, fourth in the West. This game Zhuang Shen ushered in the first show of the Lakers, the result played 14 minutes on the injury. In the first quarter, the Lakers led the bucks by two figures, but in the last three quarters, the Bucks had the absolute advantage. The final score was 97-112. The Lakers lost the bucks at home, the Lakers won two games in a row, and the Bucks lost three games in a row. After the game, the Lakers were only 0.5 games ahead of nuggets and blazers.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/06/The%20big%20three%20have%2070%20points,%20the%20Lakers%20are%20reversed!%20Zhuang%20Shen's%204-point%20injury%20in%20the%20first%20show%20makes%20it%20difficult%20for%20the%20Lakers%20to%20keep%20fourth%20place/475b6491-209a-4676-866e-9f886b786cd0.gif" alt="The big three have 70 points, the Lakers are reversed!

Bucks side, huoledi 28 points 8 rebounds 6 assists, letter brother 25 points 10 rebounds 4 assists 3 blocks 9 errors, Middleton 17 points 6 rebounds 8 assists, di Vincenzo 13 points 5 rebounds.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/06/The%20big%20three%20have%2070%20points,%20the%20Lakers%20are%20reversed!%20Zhuang%20Shen's%204-point%20injury%20in%20the%20first%20show%20makes%20it%20difficult%20for%20the%20Lakers%20to%20keep%20fourth%20place/125ab128-9efb-4e6b-9c9d-d8ee6f83215e.gif" alt="The big three have 70 points, the Lakers are reversed! Zhuang Shen&#39;s 4-point injury in the first show makes it difficult for the Lakers to keep fourth place"><br>At the beginning of the game, Huo ledi took six points from the basket in a row. After the two minute blackout, the big Morris finally shot three points to stop bleeding. After that, Zhuang Shen threw to get the first point of the Laker’s career. In the middle of the game, the Lakers suddenly broke out. Kuzma, Maurice and Schroeder scored four three-point goals in a row. The Lakers instantly opened the double-digit gap! In the second half of the game, huoledi and Middleton hit continuously. At the end of the season, Forbes and diacett also had three points. The Bucks chased all the way to narrow the difference. In the first quarter, they played 30-24 against the Lakers. The second quarter back, the Lakers into scoring shortage, Connaughton’s slam dunk, Middleton’s shot to wipe even. Kuzma made a series of hits, while Letterman and Middleton made a joint effort to score 11 points! During this period, the Lakers only got Zhuang Shen’s layup and big Morris’s free throw. In the second half of the game, the efficiency of the Lakers was still not high, and the Bucks led the team to play 14-6 again. At the end of the half, the Bucks led the Lakers 57-49.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/06/The%20big%20three%20have%2070%20points,%20the%20Lakers%20are%20reversed!%20Zhuang%20Shen's%204-point%20injury%20in%20the%20first%20show%20makes%20it%20difficult%20for%20the%20Lakers%20to%20keep%20fourth%20place/eeb38caa-3820-41a1-9622-0e881618a1da.gif" alt="The big three have 70 points, the Lakers are reversed! Zhuang Shen&#39;s 4-point injury in the first show makes it difficult for the Lakers to keep fourth place"><br>The third quarter back, Harrell and Schroeder try to chase points, and the letter of Corinna 6 points continue to expand the difference. Vogel called for a time-out in succession, and Zhuang Shen was forced to leave. The Lakers were about to collapse when Harrell stepped forward and scored 11 points under the basket, leading the Lakers to narrow the score to about 10 points. The second half of the letter, brother took turns to attack the basket, Huo ledi shot in vain, played three quarters, Bucks 89-75 Lakers. Back in the fourth quarter, brother Letterman continued to attack the basket, while Matthews’ three-point ball helped the Lakers stop bleeding. In the middle of the game, the Lakers continued to play iron, and Forbes hit the key three points. In the second half of the game, the Lakers tried to counterattack, and Harrell and Kuzma took turns to attack, but at the critical moment, two three-point balls from di Vincenzo and huoledi completely killed the suspense of the game, and finally the Lakers lost the bucks at home!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/06/The%20big%20three%20have%2070%20points,%20the%20Lakers%20are%20reversed!%20Zhuang%20Shen's%204-point%20injury%20in%20the%20first%20show%20makes%20it%20difficult%20for%20the%20Lakers%20to%20keep%20fourth%20place/e24f763d-55d8-49ac-a80e-d62389fba0d2.gif" alt="The big three have 70 points, the Lakers are reversed! Zhuang Shen&#39;s 4-point injury in the first show makes it difficult for the Lakers to keep fourth place"><br>In 14 minutes, 2 of 6 shots, 2 free throws, 4 points, 1 rebound, 2 assists, 1 block, 3 mistakes and 4 fouls. Chuang Shen’s first show of the Lakers was like little Gasol. He was also killed in the game by the letter brother to finish the violent dunk and didn’t get the rebound. But in the competition, Zhuang Shen’s right toenail also fell off, and unexpectedly withdrew from the competition. Maybe in the view of the Lakers, Zhuang Shen should be an enhanced version of Howard, with the ability to protect the frame, better personality, eat cakes and make fewer mistakes. But to be honest, when Zhuang Shen is on the scene, the pace of the Lakers is also slowing down, and Zhuang Shen and his teammates seem to lack tacit understanding. Take your time. The Lakers can’t always make up one mistake for another.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/06/The%20big%20three%20have%2070%20points,%20the%20Lakers%20are%20reversed!%20Zhuang%20Shen's%204-point%20injury%20in%20the%20first%20show%20makes%20it%20difficult%20for%20the%20Lakers%20to%20keep%20fourth%20place/de9c314f-6fa9-4dcb-b8a7-3af7a4f04684.gif" alt="The big three have 70 points, the Lakers are reversed! Zhuang Shen&#39;s 4-point injury in the first show makes it difficult for the Lakers to keep fourth place"><br>In fact, the Bucks didn’t perform well today. The letter brother made mistakes quickly in double, and Middleton’s hand feeling was relatively general. The Lakers were just not good at attacking. Of course, they can’t rely on Zhuang Shen at this stage. Zhuang Shen’s data is very good, but the effect on the court is not so good. Didn’t Schroeder refuse the four-year 84 million contract extension of the Lakers? Then he should match his salary level. If you want to get 30 million, you want to get the top salary, 6 out of 18, only 17 points and 8 assists. This data is far from enough! I hope the Lakers can hold the top six in the western conference before Jens comes back, otherwise it will be too hard!</p>
