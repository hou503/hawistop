Clipper two surprise forces broke out, the eastern Black Horse ended eight consecutive victories"><br>This is the first time that the clippers have won in a row in the past 40 days. Since February 16, the clippers have won 6-8 in their last 14 games. During this period, they also suffered three consecutive losses. For a time, they were only 0.5 games ahead of the fifth place nuggets, and the situation was in danger. Fortunately, today, Mann and Kennard stepped forward. Kennard scored 8-in-8, 3-point goal 4-in-4, and Mann scored 8-in-14. They jointly contributed 41 points to help the team out.

In the fourth quarter, he handed over the ball to Leonard and Mann to control the field.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/27/Leonard%20made%20a%2022%20point%20super%20reversal!%20Clipper%20two%20surprise%20forces%20broke%20out,%20the%20eastern%20Black%20Horse%20ended%20eight%20consecutive%20victories/86dbe320-e9aa-44f7-95a2-a6d42ed254b8.gif" alt="Leonard made a 22 point super reversal! Clipper two surprise forces broke out, the eastern Black Horse ended eight consecutive victories"><br>This morning, the Clippers sent cabbengale, protected second round lottery and cash to the king in exchange for a protected second round lottery. The purpose is very simple. They want to vacate their salary and continue to recruit. After sending off carben, the clippers have made room for a salary of $2 million. Before that, they were associated with many defenders, such as Lori, hill, Bogdan, Bauer, etc., but it is very difficult to trade them because the clippers can no longer sign in the first round. At this stage, the clippers can only aim at buying out the market, including Crawford, Jr Smith and Thomas Want to play for the championship team, but can the Clippers see them?</p>
