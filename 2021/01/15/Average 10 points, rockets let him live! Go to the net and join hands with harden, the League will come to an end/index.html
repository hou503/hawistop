        <p>After the Lakers won the championship, many teams started an arms race this season. Since harden joined the nets, the nets showed their fangs and won Griffin and Adelaide in succession. At present, the team still has room for salary. In order to attack the championship, they have never given up reinforcing the lineup. And teams like the nets, the Lakers and the Bucks, whose goal of strengthening is naturally to rebuild the team. This season, the Rockets can be regarded as sending a few favors. They send harden to their favorite nets, tucker to the bucks with championship level strength, including sending oradipo to the heat ahead of time. The Rockets do a good job indeed! The latest news, according to chalania reports, the Rockets plan to cut mcclemo as soon as possible, and now there are a number of championship teams have expressed strong interest in him!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/15/Average%2010%20points,%20rockets%20let%20him%20live!%20Go%20to%20the%20net%20and%20join%20hands%20with%20harden,%20the%20League%20will%20come%20to%20an%20end/8a759357-4c30-49b4-8364-85a593604543.gif" alt="Average 10 points, rockets let him live! Go to the net and join hands with harden, the League will come to an end"><br>When it comes to mcclemo, maybe the Rockets fans are not so impressed. After all, last season, the Rockets were banned for some special reasons. After joining the Rockets last season, mcclemo averaged 22.8 minutes per game and was able to get 10.1 points + 2.2 rebounds, with a three-point shooting rate as high as 40%. He is the most accurate three-point shooter of the Rockets team! Last season several key battles, mclermo has played a very important role. Pelicans play, mcclemo 3-point ball 9 in 4 hit 22 points, joint harden led the team to win. Playing the Knicks, mcclemo 3-point ball 9 in 4, 17 points, playing Trail Blazers 3-point ball 9 in 5, playing magic 3-point ball 7 in 6, mcclemo played 71 games last season, including 13 games, hit 4 or more 3-point ball in a single game, with the Raptors, mcclemo 3-point ball 8 in a single game, cut 28 points, lead the team to beat the powerful Raptors!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/15/Average%2010%20points,%20rockets%20let%20him%20live!%20Go%20to%20the%20net%20and%20join%20hands%20with%20harden,%20the%20League%20will%20come%20to%20an%20end/c2a65fa9-faae-4646-8cda-ab598a06eec1.gif" alt="Average 10 points, rockets let him live! Go to the net and join hands with harden, the League will come to an end"><br>As the No.7 show of 13 years, mcclemo’s career is quite twists and turns. After he was selected, he has not been given the key training. He has been regarded as a marginal role player after he has been involved in kings and Grizzlies. In fact, his advantages are very obvious, soft hand, very confident shooting, and can be a guest point guard, his shot timing is more appropriate, and his partner with harden has a high timeliness rate. Defects are also more obvious, defense efficiency is not high, in addition, the body is relatively thin, not enough confrontation, lack of enough strength, but one thing can be sure, he was on the scene, the opponent will not easily shrink the line of defense!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/15/Average%2010%20points,%20rockets%20let%20him%20live!%20Go%20to%20the%20net%20and%20join%20hands%20with%20harden,%20the%20League%20will%20come%20to%20an%20end/aa1db85e-9def-4750-8c02-1ff8b090e1ee.gif" alt="Average 10 points, rockets let him live! Go to the net and join hands with harden, the League will come to an end"><br>Last season, when he teamed up with harden and Tucker, he was the Rockets’ most efficient trio. When it comes to the playoffs, d’antony compulsorily reduces the rotation, using only weishao + harden + Green + Covington + Tucker + Gordon + house, which leads to the abandonment of him and little rivers in the playoffs. When he signed the contract with the Rockets, although the base salary offered by the rockets was $4.2 million for two years, in the first year, there was only $50000 for guarantee and Suns. If he could finish the regular season, it would be $300000 for guarantee. This type of contract, the Rockets really minimized their own risks. And mcclemo proved his strength with action, but he didn’t expect that the Rockets suddenly broke down, and he completely lost his position.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/15/Average%2010%20points,%20rockets%20let%20him%20live!%20Go%20to%20the%20net%20and%20join%20hands%20with%20harden,%20the%20League%20will%20come%20to%20an%20end/a8322870-fc10-4a33-be48-6006cf0477d0.gif" alt="Average 10 points, rockets let him live! Go to the net and join hands with harden, the League will come to an end"><br>This season, Silas used a large number of new players. Tate, little Potter, little Martin, including Patton and enwaba, have stable playing time in their health, while mclarmo is completely forgotten in the corner. Mclarmo plays an average of 16.8 minutes this season, and can get 7.4 points + 2.1 rebounds. Due to the limited playing time, and there is no stable ball right protection around him, so he leads to the failure His hit rate dropped sharply, and the three-point hit rate was only 33.1%. But if there is a passing master like harden around, I believe it is not a big problem to give him about 20 minutes of playing time per game and be able to output three three-point shots stably!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/01/15/Average%2010%20points,%20rockets%20let%20him%20live!%20Go%20to%20the%20net%20and%20join%20hands%20with%20harden,%20the%20League%20will%20come%20to%20an%20end/f249fa13-ebe7-40a9-97c6-1352cb127083.gif" alt="Average 10 points, rockets let him live! Go to the net and join hands with harden, the League will come to an end"><br>At present, there are Joe HA in the starting lineup, including Adelaide, Owen and harden. Durant, who is about to return, can shoot three points. There are also such brave players as salmete Johnson on the bench, including Clarkston, Griffin and little Jordan on the inside. But now there is still a lack of rotation in the front line and the back line. Salmete and Johnson are not stable enough, while ruwau has only 33.3% of them Three point shooting percentage, if mclermo can be bought out by the Rockets to join the nets, and continue to play the role of three-point shooter beside harden, then the nets will become more terrible, and even the League finale is expected, they can completely form two teams with the impact of the finals! Of course, also can’t wishful thinking, mcclemo such players, the Lakers also need, also very suitable for the Bucks, in short, the Rockets are willing to let him live, is the best gift! Come on, old Mac!</p>
