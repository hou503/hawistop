Congratulations to harden. Leave the rocket"><br>The NBA regular season continues. The Nets beat the Blazers in the latest game and won the 30th game of the season, which also equaled the team’s record of the fastest 30 wins in a single season. The nets made it to the finals in 2002 and 2003 respectively. In the absence of Durant, Owen and shamet, harden played a subjective initiative and fully mobilized the potential of every teammate. However, the nets are a big three team, but they played a wonderful team basketball in the absence of major general. Harden has contributed a lot! Of course, a hero three help, harden led the team to win, can not do without the excellent play of his teammates, and harden came to the net to play 30 games, the new cake king, this is also a legendary story!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/04/11/16%20points%20+%2016%20points,%20full%20attack%20and%20defense%20talent%20burst!%20Congratulations%20to%20harden.%20Leave%20the%20rocket/44e544e5-4dda-412d-b465-064d8eb3af9c.gif" alt="16 points + 16 points, full attack and defense talent burst! Congratulations to harden. Leave the rocket"><br>Clarkston, who was not in the future plan of the nets at the beginning of the season, has become a rising star in the nets. At present, Clarkston has played 12 games for the net, averaging 18 minutes per game, and can get 9.8 points + 4.3 rebounds + 1.6 blocks. If converted into the standard 36 minutes, Clarkston also handed over an all star level data. Clarkston’s high-level data is even more gratifying. The offensive efficiency is 119.5, the fifth in the league, the defensive efficiency is 99.1, the fifth in the league, the net efficiency is 20.4, the first in the League! In addition, Clarkston field average positive and negative value is + 7.4, ranking ninth in the League! Why did Clarkston, who turned 22 in April, perform so well?<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/04/11/16%20points%20+%2016%20points,%20full%20attack%20and%20defense%20talent%20burst!%20Congratulations%20to%20harden.%20Leave%20the%20rocket/9133efd7-2b02-48ff-9b29-253a86a7b187.gif" alt="16 points + 16 points, full attack and defense talent burst! Congratulations to harden. Leave the rocket"><br>In the summer of 19, Clarkston was selected by the nets in the first place in the second round. His height of 2.11 meters, arm spread of 2.20 meters, weight of less than 100 kg, looked very thin, but this also became the key to his foothold in the nets. As a matter of fact, Clarkston was born as a point guard and had good ball holding skills. Because of his height, he began to play No. 5 after entering the University. But he has the jump shot and the ball attack ability that the conventional center does not have. In addition, his arm spread makes him have excellent blocking and stealing ability. And in the past 12 games, Clarkston continues to evolve, as if has become the backbones of the nets inside!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/04/11/16%20points%20+%2016%20points,%20full%20attack%20and%20defense%20talent%20burst!%20Congratulations%20to%20harden.%20Leave%20the%20rocket/7690dff7-308b-4008-a32c-d3da19bee8b1.gif" alt="16 points + 16 points, full attack and defense talent burst! Congratulations to harden. Leave the rocket"><br>Playing the wizard, Clarkston played 26 minutes, 7 in 10, got 16 points, 3 rebounds and 3 blocks, especially blocked the big volleyball cap of Kawamura, which made people see his amazing talent. In the game with the Blazers, Clarkston played for 22 minutes, 8 out of 10, got 16 points and 9 rebounds (4 front court). In the fourth quarter, Nash let Clarkston partner Griffin. Clarkston was light weight, moved very fast, and could change defense infinitely. Against the top guard, lilard and mcclem, they were dumb in the fourth quarter, because they used to face pick and roll In the face of slow, no defensive pressure inside, and Clarkston is not afraid of double gun combination. Compared with the former cake emperor Capella, although Clarkston is the same height, he has the ability of big defense and small defense, and he can keep up with the first time of breaking through. That’s enough!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/04/11/16%20points%20+%2016%20points,%20full%20attack%20and%20defense%20talent%20burst!%20Congratulations%20to%20harden.%20Leave%20the%20rocket/72de2771-93fa-44d2-9ce6-9096369ecba0.gif" alt="16 points + 16 points, full attack and defense talent burst! Congratulations to harden. Leave the rocket"><br>In Clarkston’s own words: “a lot of other teams or players think our defense is weak. I want to say that as long as I am present, I want to be the commander of the defensive end. I know that I can defend from position one to position five. It’s not difficult In addition, Clarkston also highly praised harden’s pie feeding technique, in his own words: “as long as I run to the right position, he always makes me score easily.” Indeed, what Clarkston said is true. Before the basketball nets training match, Clarkston said that every time he played against Durant, he was not at a disadvantage! What level is Durant, one of the best small forwards in the league, Clarkston can start from the devil’s difficulty, it’s natural to face other opponents!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/04/11/16%20points%20+%2016%20points,%20full%20attack%20and%20defense%20talent%20burst!%20Congratulations%20to%20harden.%20Leave%20the%20rocket/9611b6a7-26a6-4907-b0aa-b26685221d83.gif" alt="16 points + 16 points, full attack and defense talent burst! Congratulations to harden. Leave the rocket"><br>In fact, Clarkston in today’s role of the net, has reached an irreplaceable point! Even if the nets have the chance to sign Zhuang Shen in the future, in the cruel playoffs, Zhuang Shen’s speed and rhythm will really drag down the nets, including little Jordan now. Squatting defense is the biggest burden for the nets, because they can constantly use faster rhythm to tear up the opponent’s defense. In this case, Clarkston’s unlimited defense changing ability, his offensive impact, including the ability to eat cakes, and his blocking limit level for shooting players, have all met the daily rotation needs of the nets. He has only played 12 games, and has become the most fierce firepower point of the nets bench. He is less than 22 years old, and youth is the biggest advantage!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/04/11/16%20points%20+%2016%20points,%20full%20attack%20and%20defense%20talent%20burst!%20Congratulations%20to%20harden.%20Leave%20the%20rocket/9b3da4a5-d130-41df-857b-bdfde572b105.gif" alt="16 points + 16 points, full attack and defense talent burst! Congratulations to harden. Leave the rocket"><br>Congratulations to harden. After you leave the rocket, you can make a cake again! In fact, for young players, the fastest way to grow up is driven by the stars around. In this net, because of the existence of harden, everyone is trying to create a more comfortable shooting space, including Owen, brown and green, who often feed Clarkston cakes. This kind of stable performance will quickly improve the self-confidence of young players! It is believed that with the accumulation of competition experience and the addition of some tonnage, he can also become an excellent protector of dominating basketball like Capella. As long as stay in the nets, stay around the big three, the young man’s future is limitless!</p>
