        <p>On March 29, Beijing time, the NBA regular season continued, with the Lakers playing magic at home. Before that, the Lakers were 29-17, ranking fourth in the western region, and the magic were 15-30, ranking second from the bottom in the eastern region. Zhuang Shen was unable to play in this game, while the magic, in the window period, sent off the four main players of the team, aimed at lousy. In the second quarter, when the Lakers were 13 points ahead of their opponents, they had no feeling at all in the second half, but Kuzma stepped out at the critical moment of the fourth quarter and led the team to play a 10-0 climax to turn the situation around! 96-93, the Lakers narrowly beat the magic at home, after the game, the Lakers are still 1.5 games ahead of nuggets and blazers.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/04/04/21%20+%2024%20+%2018!%20The%20Lakers%20have%20won%20two%20games%20in%20a%20row,%20and%20the%20eastern%20tank%20team%20has%20nearly%20turned%20over/6c86f60b-73b0-4efb-bf22-920072375f50.gif" alt="21 + 24 + 18! The Lakers have won two games in a row, and the eastern tank team has nearly turned over"><br>Data, on the Laker side, Kuzma has 21 points, 11 rebounds and 4 assists, Schroeder has 24 points, 6 assists and 5 rebounds, Harrell has 18 points, 11 rebounds, Morris has 12 points and 11 rebounds, and Gasol has 7 points and 3 assists. On the magic side, bacon has 26 points and 8 rebounds, OKiKi has 14 points and 6 rebounds and 3 assists, Hampton has 10 points, Bamba has 11 points and 7 rebounds, Ennis has 9 points and 4 rebounds.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/04/04/21%20+%2024%20+%2018!%20The%20Lakers%20have%20won%20two%20games%20in%20a%20row,%20and%20the%20eastern%20tank%20team%20has%20nearly%20turned%20over/3d578adc-e82a-40c4-ba73-5d5425b9934b.gif" alt="21 + 24 + 18! The Lakers have won two games in a row, and the eastern tank team has nearly turned over"><br>At the beginning of the first quarter, Gasol and Maurice didn’t touch the box in three points, while the magic relied on birch and bacon to get four points. After that, Kuzma scored two three-point goals and led the team to an 8-0 climax. The magic blossomed a lot. Schroeder scored four points in a row and OKiKi scored two three-point goals. At the end of the festival, Harrell kept on attacking and killing. The magic relied on young players Randall and porter to respond. In the first quarter, the Lakers had a 22-21 magic. Back in the second quarter, Caruso and Harrell scored five points in a row, Tucker also hit the layup, the magic continued to play iron, and Matthews chased three points to help the Lakers open a double-digit point gap. In the second half, the Lakers fell into scoring shortage. Pop, Schroeder and Kuzma failed to score three points in a row, while the magic’s Bacon’s inside out shot scored seven points in a row, leading the team to narrow the difference again. At the end of the half, the Lakers won the 44-39 magic.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/04/04/21%20+%2024%20+%2018!%20The%20Lakers%20have%20won%20two%20games%20in%20a%20row,%20and%20the%20eastern%20tank%20team%20has%20nearly%20turned%20over/a4cd5165-0d7b-4962-9193-42957c30215d.gif" alt="21 + 24 + 18! The Lakers have won two games in a row, and the eastern tank team has nearly turned over"><br>Back in the third quarter, Michael and Maurice continued to score three points. Magic relied on Bacon and Randall to level the difference. At the critical moment, Kuzma responded with three points, Schroeder scored two more points, and Maurice scored two three points in the middle. In the second half, the Lakers fell into scoring shortage again. Bamba’s slam dunk, Bacon’s three points, Ennis’s three points, magic easily leveled the difference, and porter was super late in the quarter Three points into the distance, three quarters, two teams into 69 draw! Back in the fourth quarter, Kuzma and Xiaojia scored three points, Bamba responded with five points, Schroeder scored five points, while bacon and Ennis led the team to beat the Lakers 85-80! At the critical moment, Kuzma led the team to make a 10-0 climax. At the decisive moment, Schroeder made a continuous breakthrough to kill and hit six free throws. At the last moment, bacon and Carter scored four points. In the last 30 seconds, Schroeder missed the layup, big Morris missed the three points, Porter missed the three points, and the Lakers won the game!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/04/04/21%20+%2024%20+%2018!%20The%20Lakers%20have%20won%20two%20games%20in%20a%20row,%20and%20the%20eastern%20tank%20team%20has%20nearly%20turned%20over/321950d5-1722-4d33-b83b-f03dacf72c00.gif" alt="21 + 24 + 18! The Lakers have won two games in a row, and the eastern tank team has nearly turned over"><br>Finally, I can see the real level of this Laker. In fact, when James leads the team alone, it’s really not easy for the Lakers to hold the second place in the West. In the absence of James, Schroeder can’t control the whole team. On the contrary, Kuzma’s performance is relatively stable, but today’s feeling is not good. In addition to Kuzma, Harrell and Schroeder, the Lakers now have no stable scoring points, which is the biggest problem. Since James was injured, the offensive efficiency and 100 round net score of the Lakers are the last five in the league. Zhuang Shen’s joining is like rain in time, which can protect rebounds and provide stable 15 + 15 output per game. I believe the Lakers are at least much better than now.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/04/04/21%20+%2024%20+%2018!%20The%20Lakers%20have%20won%20two%20games%20in%20a%20row,%20and%20the%20eastern%20tank%20team%20has%20nearly%20turned%20over/1d2e4fb1-02da-49e5-b9cd-6a4a6b71b2fe.gif" alt="21 + 24 + 18! The Lakers have won two games in a row, and the eastern tank team has nearly turned over"><br>The next game for the Lakers is very, very difficult. The next game is against bucks, and then there is a wave of road trip, which is against kings, clippers, raptors, heat, nets, Knicks, Hornets in a row. In addition to kings, the others are not soft persimmons. Gloria, Jen’s mother, revealed that Jen may be out of action for four weeks. If the Lakers want to keep the top six position in the west, they should not only keep the role players in their current state, but also hope Davis will return as soon as possible. Once it falls out of the sixth place and starts from the playoff, it will be more passive.</p>
