The Clippers beat the Trail Blazers and pulled the Laker. The Laker also won the Raptors. At present, the Laker is holding the fifth position, while the Trail Blazers still have a lone ranger behind them. The warriors are still in 10th place after losing three times in a row, but the situation is not optimistic. They are 6.5 games away from the sixth place blazers. The last few did not change, the Timberwolves pull the rocket, hand in hand impact champion sign.</p>
