        <p>The warriors don’t have to watch the game, they lose again. In the latest game, curry came back and the warriors challenged the eagles. In the first three quarters, curry took the initiative. In the first half of the fourth quarter, curry sat on the bench and watched his teammates being bullied by the eagles’ substitutes Gary Nari and Mike Rowe. When curry came on the court, the Hawks substitute was even more unstoppable. He combined with Capella to make a final volley. Curry scored 37 points, 5 rebounds and 8 mistakes. Cole retired after the game: “he will still feel some discomfort, he is not at his best, his mistakes tonight are really a problem, he has done everything to win.” Cole’s voice over: if curry gets more points and makes fewer mistakes, the game will be won!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/02/22/7%20losses%20in%208%20games,%2017%20points%20per%20game,%20self%20deception!%20It's%20all%20Kuri's%20fault.%20He%20should%20have%20left%20long%20ago/a4bfe109-732a-4a40-822e-474bacefd069.gif" alt="7 losses in 8 games, 17 points per game, self deception! It&#39;s all Kuri&#39;s fault. He should have left long ago"><br>In the past eight games, curry has played three, and the warriors are 1-7. The Grizzlies, the 76ers, the kings and the eagles were beaten by 22 points and 16 points respectively. When curry came back, he led the team to beat the bulls. In the next game, curry scored 36 points and the warriors lost the heat. By Raptors blood wash 53 points, including the latest one lost eagles, warriors 8 battle 7 lose, 7 games total lost 122 points, game average lost 17.4 points! Up to now, 23-27, only 0.5 games ahead of pelicans and 1 game ahead of kings, not to mention steadily entering the playoffs. Now even the qualification is a luxury. What if you are squeezed out of the top ten? That curry single core can’t lead the team into the playoffs, what’s the problem? Pay the most taxes and get the most blows. Why didn’t the warrior fall so fast?<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/02/22/7%20losses%20in%208%20games,%2017%20points%20per%20game,%20self%20deception!%20It's%20all%20Kuri's%20fault.%20He%20should%20have%20left%20long%20ago/e229f314-d1b9-4270-8ca3-39eae5c9e303.gif" alt="7 losses in 8 games, 17 points per game, self deception! It&#39;s all Kuri&#39;s fault. He should have left long ago"><br>Cole was a great credit to the warriors who retreated so fast. In the last six minutes, he pinched curry on the table, which has become Cole’s routine operation this season. In the 27 games lost by the warriors this season, six of them were turned over by the opponent in the first half of the fourth quarter, leading to the failure of filling the hole in the second half! Even if Damien Lee and ubre kept making mistakes and beating iron, Cole decided that curry could lead the team to turn over in the last six minutes. In addition, Cole likes to pass and cut, but he doesn’t like to pick and roll, but Cole likes to let Wiseman in the starting line-up and let green and Wiseman make false cover for curry. Everyone knows that green and Wiseman have no projection ability. Curry is trapped by many people as long as he is covered by pick and roll. Only Cole can think of such a self humiliating attack way in the whole league.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/02/22/7%20losses%20in%208%20games,%2017%20points%20per%20game,%20self%20deception!%20It's%20all%20Kuri's%20fault.%20He%20should%20have%20left%20long%20ago/a7738d28-887c-4342-9065-0db62a5baa0d.gif" alt="7 losses in 8 games, 17 points per game, self deception! It&#39;s all Kuri&#39;s fault. He should have left long ago"><br>Talk about Wiseman. Averaging 11.4 points and 5.8 rebounds per game, the five player group with the highest starting efficiency in the league this season is from the warriors. Yes, when Wiseman is replaced by Rooney, the net efficiency is the highest, but the playing time is very little. Cole also put Wiseman on the bench, but maybe he felt that was delaying Wiseman’s talent and bringing him to the starting line-up. Don’t look at the warriors’ whole game, even if you look at the warriors’ collection, you can know how “strong” Wiseman is. It is mentioned that the three-point line outside the crotch dribble is the basic operation. There are at least two walking violations in each game. The low position catch is often robbed by the opponent. Grabbing a rebound is also easy to foul, not to mention that he covers his teammates, including grabbing a rebound with his teammates, including taking the bottom corner position and trying Hit the basket with the ball. The 21-year-old 2.13-meter rookie Wiseman may have a high heart, or Cole’s improper use of personnel. In a word, compared with his fellow players and Edwards, he is far better!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/02/22/7%20losses%20in%208%20games,%2017%20points%20per%20game,%20self%20deception!%20It's%20all%20Kuri's%20fault.%20He%20should%20have%20left%20long%20ago/21a17c65-1951-4412-bc11-c15d574f50bd.gif" alt="7 losses in 8 games, 17 points per game, self deception! It&#39;s all Kuri&#39;s fault. He should have left long ago"><br>Talk about Wiggins. With an average of 18.2 points, 4.8 rebounds and 2.3 assists per game, Wiggins’s defensive performance this season is beyond doubt. His ability to limit the opponent’s shooting percentage is the top ten level in the league. The shooting percentage includes three-point shooting percentage and Curry’s level, which are 47.5% + 40%. Wiggins often performs 15 points in a single section, but the other three sections are basically invisible. The fans who don’t watch the ball are saying that Wiggins is healthy and Wiggins doesn’t like to attack, but Cole has never designed a singles tactic for Wiggins. Here, only green has the right to deal cards, and only curry has the right to play singles. The rest of the players are passing pieces. Yes, Wiggins can lead the substitute to score continuously, and can score 40 points when curry is absent. But most of the time, Wiggins follows the turn back and runs without the right to the ball. When curry plays singles, his teammates know how to run and pull. When Wiggins plays singles, he always sticks in the same place.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/02/22/7%20losses%20in%208%20games,%2017%20points%20per%20game,%20self%20deception!%20It's%20all%20Kuri's%20fault.%20He%20should%20have%20left%20long%20ago/657212b9-44ea-48f8-93dc-49d0eaca3007.gif" alt="7 losses in 8 games, 17 points per game, self deception! It&#39;s all Kuri&#39;s fault. He should have left long ago"><br>Don’t blame Cole. He’s used to championship thinking. In the past few years, the three championship trophies have made him very confident, and also let him taste the sweetness of passing and cutting. Don’t blame green. At the beginning of the deal, we were surrounded by brothers Shuihua and Durant. Now what are these teammates? I can’t blame Wiggins. He has the ability to score and chisel. Have you arranged his tactics? Don’t blame Wiseman, rookies need to accumulate competition, now it’s understandable to make mistakes. After all, it can only be blamed on curry. Maybe you should choose to leave, maybe you should have chosen to leave long ago, wake up Cole from the dream, pull down the management of the warriors from the top of the past glory, and recognize the reality. Success is not only a simple accumulation of stars, let alone 25 million on the field and 40 million off the field. If curry leaves, the warriors will rot and maybe next season will come true.</p>
