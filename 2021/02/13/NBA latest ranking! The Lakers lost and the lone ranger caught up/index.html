        <p>Beijing time on April 9, NBA regular season continues, today a total of seven games, the Lakers lost to the heat, as expected. The Bucks don’t make it, they crash at the end. The game between the jazz and the Blazers turned to be one-sided. The most wonderful thing was the Clippers against the suns. Cary’s play in the second half was unreasonable. The Tomahawk made Aton cool! And the eastern penultimate piston is not lonely, secretly beat the king to prove his sense of existence. Let’s take a look at the key games and the latest ranking.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/02/13/NBA%20latest%20ranking!%20The%20Lakers%20lost%20and%20the%20lone%20ranger%20caught%20up/6554c316-700f-4576-8a7d-4b0ad6e7c782.gif" alt="NBA latest ranking! The Lakers lost and the lone ranger caught up"><br>**The Lakers 104-110 heat. **<br>Kuzma was also injured. Mclermo made his debut. The Lakers were 11 points behind their opponents in the first quarter, and the heat were dumb in the second quarter. In the third quarter, the two sides fell into a stalemate. In the fourth quarter, the heat relied on Butler and Hiro to open the difference, and pop stopped bleeding by three points. At the decisive moment, Maurice was expelled for complaining about the referee. After that, Matthews and pop shot three points, but the time went by, and the Lakers finally lost to the heat. Data, on the Laker side, Pop has 28 points and 4 rebounds, Zhuang Shen has 15 points and 12 rebounds, Matthews has 14 points, Morris has 12 points, Schroeder has 10 points and 14 assists and 7 errors, Harrell has 10 points and 9 rebounds. Heat side, Butler 28 points, 7 rebounds, 4 assists, oradibo 18 points, 4 rebounds, Adebayor 13 points, 7 rebounds.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/02/13/NBA%20latest%20ranking!%20The%20Lakers%20lost%20and%20the%20lone%20ranger%20caught%20up/3e648cbf-9775-4ec6-8595-3af646144f07.gif" alt="NBA latest ranking! The Lakers lost and the lone ranger caught up"><br>**Pioneer 103-122. **<br>In the first quarter, the Blazers relied on the three-point ball of mcclem, Powell and Lillard to seize the score. In the second quarter, the Jazz tried to open the gap, but the Blazers played a wave of 12-0 in the middle to complete the reverse. In the third quarter, Mitchell led the team to blossom more, and the Jazz played a wave of 25-4 climax in the middle, directly pulling the difference to more than 20 points. In the fourth quarter, the Blazers’ several counter attacks were solved by Mitchell’s continuous scoring. In the end, the Blazers gave up their resistance and the Jazz easily won. Data, on the Trail Blazers side, lilard has 23 points, 5 rebounds, 6 assists, mclarm has 19 points, 3 rebounds, Powell has 13 points and Anthony has 7 points. On the Jazz side, Mitchell has 37 points, 5 rebounds and 4 assists, Gerber has 18 points, 21 rebounds, ingers has 13 points, 6 assists and Boyan has 11 points and 5 rebounds.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/02/13/NBA%20latest%20ranking!%20The%20Lakers%20lost%20and%20the%20lone%20ranger%20caught%20up/d60002e4-424d-4d9a-b0bf-ffb09b1ed0a6.gif" alt="NBA latest ranking! The Lakers lost and the lone ranger caught up"><br>**The sun 103-113 clipper. **<br>In the first half, the two sides were very glued. In the first quarter, the Clippers took the lead in the second half. In the second quarter, the Clippers made mistakes, George fouled too much, and the Suns seized the opportunity to surpass. In the third quarter, the Clippers broke out, and the small card buckled continuously to reverse the decline, while in the fourth quarter, both sides played the smell of gunpowder, Beverly was expelled, little Morris was expelled, and the Clippers relied on Rondo and George’s three-point rain to kill the suspense of the game! Data, clippers side, Booker 24 points 3 rebounds 3 assists, bridges 20 points 5 rebounds, Aton 18 points 10 rebounds, Paul 13 points 7 rebounds. On the Suns side, George has 33 points and 7 rebounds, Leonard has 27 points and 5 rebounds and 5 assists, Rondo has 15 points and 3 rebounds and 9 assists.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/02/13/NBA%20latest%20ranking!%20The%20Lakers%20lost%20and%20the%20lone%20ranger%20caught%20up/ca060949-a5dc-445b-99ec-ba095371c20b.gif" alt="NBA latest ranking! The Lakers lost and the lone ranger caught up"><br>In other games, the Raptors lost 113-122 to the bulls, and Boucher scored 38 points and 19 rebounds. Cavaliers 129-102 thunder, Lefu 18 points and 11 rebounds, thunder 5 losses in a row. Lone ranger 116-101 bucks, Poseidon 26 points and 17 rebounds, Dong Qiqi 27 points and 9 rebounds and 9 assists. Piston 113-101 king.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/02/13/NBA%20latest%20ranking!%20The%20Lakers%20lost%20and%20the%20lone%20ranger%20caught%20up/e21f881c-9b6b-4b25-8ebe-2d4253fcc7ad.gif" alt="NBA latest ranking! The Lakers lost and the lone ranger caught up"><br>In the latest ranking of the eastern region, the nets and the 76ers did not play, ranking in the top two in the eastern region. After the Bucks lost, the gap between them was widened. How about brother letterman’s knee injury? Hornets, eagles, heat and green army are still lingering together, regardless of you and me. After the Bulls beat the Raptors, there is less hope for the latter teams to enter the playoffs. Pistons have nothing to do with the world. Win a ball to prove that they have been in the world.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/02/13/NBA%20latest%20ranking!%20The%20Lakers%20lost%20and%20the%20lone%20ranger%20caught%20up/f6212d59-cffe-4ac2-9434-560bae77c39b.gif" alt="NBA latest ranking! The Lakers lost and the lone ranger caught up"><br>In the latest Western ranking, the Jazz won, the Suns lost, and the gap between the two teams widened to 2.5 games. After beating the sun, the clipper took the third place with a relatively stable position. The Lakers lost, but the Trail Blazers behind didn’t grasp the opportunity. Now the biggest suspense in the western region is the three teams of the Lakers, the Trail Blazers and the lone ranger. Who can get the straight through ticket to the playoffs? Hopefully the Lakers will hold the top six in the west before Jens returns. The gap behind is relatively large. After the thunder’s five consecutive losses, they still can’t see the exhaust gas of the Rockets. That’s the gap!</p>
