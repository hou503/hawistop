Adelaide made his debut with a net win, Nuggets tied the Lakers, and the Wizards fell into the rotten zone"><br>In the latest ranking of the East, the nets continue to hold the first position in the East with four consecutive wins. The 76ers win 0.5 games behind the nets. Can the 76ers regain the first position in the East with the return of enbid in the next game? The Bucks dare not make a sound behind the two giants, while the Hornets, the heat and the Knicks have been thrown away for 300 meters. At present, there are only 2.5 wins to go from the fourth Hornets to the ninth Pacers, and the competition is fierce. At the bottom of the list, magic, Cavaliers and pistons are surrounded by a wizard, who is defeated 10 times in 13 battles.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/02/16/NBA%20rankings!%20Adelaide%20made%20his%20debut%20with%20a%20net%20win,%20Nuggets%20tied%20the%20Lakers,%20and%20the%20Wizards%20fell%20into%20the%20rotten%20zone/06a88d7f-39f3-4f30-929f-8da3611e052b.gif" alt="NBA rankings! Adelaide made his debut with a net win, Nuggets tied the Lakers, and the Wizards fell into the rotten zone"><br>In the latest ranking of the western region, the Jazz continued to rank first with 36-11, the Suns were three games behind, and the clippers were still third after two consecutive defeats. The Lakers had a hard time. After a wave of four consecutive wins by the Nuggets, their record caught up with the Lakers, but they were not as good as the Lakers in the division, so they were temporarily ranked fifth. It’s just a matter of time before the Lakers fall out of the top four. The middle few have not changed much. Now there is little suspense about the top of the Western League, and there is little suspense about the qualification of the playoffs. Only the bottom is a little suspense. The Rockets are determined to compete with the Timberwolves until the last minute.</p>
