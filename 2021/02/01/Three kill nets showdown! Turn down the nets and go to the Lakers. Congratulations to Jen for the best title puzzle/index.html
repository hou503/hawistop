        <p>After the Lakers won the championship last season, the arms race among all teams in the league has intensified this season. The clippers have won such valiant players as Ibaka, Batum and Kennard in the off-season. The Lakers have also won Harrell and Schroeder. The nets have set up super luxury Galaxy warship, Owen + Durant + harden, supplemented by the super lineup of AD + Griffin, which makes people call for the grand finale of the league. Of course, the championship must not be simply the superposition of paper strength, otherwise last season’s championship should be awarded directly to the Clippers. In a recent game, the nets led by Durant, Owen and Adelaide were defeated by 25 points, which surprised the Lakers who gave up a starting lineup! And the biggest hero of the Lakers is Zhuang Shen Drummond.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/02/01/Three%20kill%20nets%20showdown!%20Turn%20down%20the%20nets%20and%20go%20to%20the%20Lakers.%20Congratulations%20to%20Jen%20for%20the%20best%20title%20puzzle/d189a95a-a6f3-4d7f-836b-ab1cb46b7194.gif" alt="Three kill nets showdown! Turn down the nets and go to the Lakers. Congratulations to Jen for the best title puzzle"><br>In the third quarter of the game between the Lakers and the nets, Zhuang Shen received Tucker’s pass and pushed Adelaide’s back all the way from the right arc top to the basket. After shaking Adelaide, Zhuang Shen got up to open Adelaide and finished 2 + 1! And Durant could not cause any substantial interference to Zhuang Shen. After the whistle rang, Zhuang Shen turned his back and made a gesture beside Durant: press down one meter from the ground with his hand, indicating “you are too small!” Zhuang Shen clarified after the match: This is my usual celebration action, not aimed at anyone. And off the court, the big three of the Lakers are celebrating! This is the epitome of Zhuang Shen in the face of the net. In front of Zhuang Shen, Adelaide is like a child and can’t stand Zhuang Shen’s fierce attack. Zhuang Shen 8 in 15 got 20 points 11 rebounds, positive and negative value + 18, Adelaide 5 in 8 got 12 points 3 rebounds 2 assists, positive and negative value - 15, the lowest starting point.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/02/01/Three%20kill%20nets%20showdown!%20Turn%20down%20the%20nets%20and%20go%20to%20the%20Lakers.%20Congratulations%20to%20Jen%20for%20the%20best%20title%20puzzle/2f726336-b7f0-41da-92d2-9d23c667265c.gif" alt="Three kill nets showdown! Turn down the nets and go to the Lakers. Congratulations to Jen for the best title puzzle"><br>It has to be said that Zhuang Shen is really the biggest killer of this net! On January 21, the nets lost to the Cavaliers in double overtime. In that game, Zhuang Shen scored 6 in 13 and got 13 points and 7 rebounds. Two days later, he played the nets again. Zhuang Shen scored 8 in 13 and got 19 points and 16 rebounds, representing the Lakers against the nets. Zhuang Shen scored 8 in 15 and got 20 points and 11 rebounds in 22 minutes. Against the nets in three games, Zhuang Shen averaged 17 points and 11 rebounds, beating Jordan and Adelaide! In the game against the nets, Zhuang Shen became the second player in the history of the Lakers who played 22 minutes or less and was able to score at least 20 points and 10 rebounds. The last one was the famous Laker Bob McAdoo. In Adelaide’s words, he is frustrated with his defensive performance against Zhuang Shen!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/02/01/Three%20kill%20nets%20showdown!%20Turn%20down%20the%20nets%20and%20go%20to%20the%20Lakers.%20Congratulations%20to%20Jen%20for%20the%20best%20title%20puzzle/8018164b-2e06-437b-bb6d-e204d1b71ced.gif" alt="Three kill nets showdown! Turn down the nets and go to the Lakers. Congratulations to Jen for the best title puzzle"><br>Since February 13 on behalf of the Cavaliers finished playing trailblazers, Zhuang Shen was abandoned by the Cavaliers, the Cavaliers determined to send out Zhuang Shen as soon as possible, so directly deprived of his playing time. Before the trading window, the Cavaliers reduced their offer, even if they used the second round of signing to trade Zhuangshen, they were willing to agree. Unfortunately, no one in the alliance was willing to take over Zhuangshen. Compared with Zhuang Shen, Griffin and Adelaide are too happy. Griffin and piston are easy to get together and disperse. The piston does not set too high a threshold to let him join the nets smoothly. Adelaide is friendly negotiations with the Spurs, the Spurs are not willing to delay Adelaide’s last chance to win the championship, agreed to buy him out, after careful consideration, Adelaide accepted Durant’s recruitment to join the nets. Zhuang Shen and Cavaliers in the completion of the buyout, including the green army, the nets, the Lakers and other teams are interested in him, if he joined the nets, then directly announced the season finale!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/02/01/Three%20kill%20nets%20showdown!%20Turn%20down%20the%20nets%20and%20go%20to%20the%20Lakers.%20Congratulations%20to%20Jen%20for%20the%20best%20title%20puzzle/d3ffd917-e3d2-40e6-a888-496dbd728e66.gif" alt="Three kill nets showdown! Turn down the nets and go to the Lakers. Congratulations to Jen for the best title puzzle"><br>Zhuang Shen is too clever! In fact, the defensive system of the layup net is very unfriendly to the stationing center. The abandonment of little Jordan is a precedent. Adelaide’s projection type interior line is the favorite of the nets. When Zhuang Shen’s contract year comes, he needs stable starting opportunities and ball rights. He needs data to support him to get the next big contract. In addition, compared with the new lineup system of the nets, the lineup of the Lakers is more stable. Before James and thick eyebrow are injured, the defensive efficiency of the Lakers is 106.8, ranking first in the league. After James and thick eyebrow are injured, the defensive efficiency of the Lakers is increased to 105.2, still maintaining the highest defensive efficiency in the league. Here in Vogel, Zhuang Shen can also constantly polish his defensive skills. For him and the Lakers, mutual cooperation makes a win-win situation!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/02/01/Three%20kill%20nets%20showdown!%20Turn%20down%20the%20nets%20and%20go%20to%20the%20Lakers.%20Congratulations%20to%20Jen%20for%20the%20best%20title%20puzzle/2ccb1e69-9ee2-42e9-8da4-8d6ffdf1bdde.gif" alt="Three kill nets showdown! Turn down the nets and go to the Lakers. Congratulations to Jen for the best title puzzle"><br>Congratulations to James, welcome the best winning puzzle! In the off-season, the Lakers sent away McKee and Howard. With little Gasol alone, the interior defense is really a big problem. Davis, including Jen and Kuzma, had to participate in the work of protecting the frame, while the arrival of Zhuang Shen completely liberated his teammates. Zhuang Shen’s rebounding rate is higher than Howard’s. In addition, Zhuang Shen has a certain low back singles ability. If he and Davis play at the same time, the Lakers will be in the interior Rebuild the mobile Great Wall! Zhuang Shen has become the biggest nemesis of the nets, which is also the biggest capital of the Lakers against the nets this season!</p>
