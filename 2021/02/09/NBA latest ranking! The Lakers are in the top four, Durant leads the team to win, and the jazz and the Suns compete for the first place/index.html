After a wave of three consecutive wins, the hawks were still four games away from the Bucks, and the green army returned to the top six after four consecutive wins. The Knicks and the Hornets have been 5-5 in the last 10 games, both of which tend to fall behind. The Pacers and bulls have fallen behind. The wizards and Raptors are further away from the playoffs. The last three are the same, but the third swordsman is the worst.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/02/09/NBA%20latest%20ranking!%20The%20Lakers%20are%20in%20the%20top%20four,%20Durant%20leads%20the%20team%20to%20win,%20and%20the%20jazz%20and%20the%20Suns%20compete%20for%20the%20first%20place/730e9233-6184-41d4-a158-275ba8c890dc.gif" alt="NBA latest ranking! The Lakers are in the top four, Durant leads the team to win, and the jazz and the Suns compete for the first place"><br>The latest ranking of the West. The Jazz beat the thunder at home, and the Suns beat the heat. The two teams still have a 1.5-game gap. Don’t make mistakes. The Suns have won 9 of the last 10 games, and the momentum is too fierce. After the Clippers won 6 games in a row, they clenched the sun. After the first three were basically locked, the future of nuggets became uncertain with Murray’s season. The Lakers won 6 games in nearly 10 games, narrowing the gap with nuggets, leaving only 0.5 games. The best gift for Jen and Davis is that the Lakers can keep fifth place in the West. From Grizzlies to pelicans, the competition is still fierce. In the last four places, the king lost seven times in a row and the thunder lost seven times in a row, but they are far away from the rockets and the Timberwolves. It’s not a day’s cold, and the Rockets are the ugly daughter-in-law.</p>
