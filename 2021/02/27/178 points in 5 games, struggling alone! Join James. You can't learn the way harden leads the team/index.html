        <p>There is no eternal Dynasty in the NBA. When Durant left, clay lost the season and the warriors fell. During the off-season of last year, when clay announced the reimbursement of the season again, curry said frankly that he would not give up the new season, and the warriors did not give up the new season, and tried their best to recruit. In order to get ubre, the warriors did not hesitate to spend an extra 68 million luxury tax. They have courage and courage, but the situation of the Warriors is not optimistic. At present, the warriors are only 24-28, ranking 10th in the West. They are on the edge of the playoffs, only one game ahead of pelicans and two games ahead of kings. 178 points in 5 games, struggling alone! Join hands with Jen. You can’t learn the way harden leads the team.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/02/27/178%20points%20in%205%20games,%20struggling%20alone!%20Join%20James.%20You%20can't%20learn%20the%20way%20harden%20leads%20the%20team/80ae0a4c-3298-440e-bf80-84af0d23da04.gif" alt="178 points in 5 games, struggling alone! Join James. You can&#39;t learn the way harden leads the team"><br>Before the game with the Grizzlies, curry’s tailbone was injured, and then recuperated for more than 10 days. After coming back again, he beat the bulls with 11 in 24, 32 points, 5 rebounds and 6 assists, and the warriors beat the opponents; he beat the heat with 9 in 19, 36 points, 11 rebounds and 3 assists, and the warriors were defeated; when he played with the Raptors, curry was injured, and the warriors were defeated with 53 points, and were washed away by the remnant Raptors! Play hawks, curry 23 in 12, got 37 points, 5 rebounds and 8 mistakes, the team lost again! The Bucks, who are short of letter brother, have 41 points, 6 rebounds and 4 assists in 14 shots in 21, leading the team to a narrow victory with 1 point! In the latest game, curry got 32 points, 6 rebounds and 5 assists in 11 of 25, and the warriors lost three points! Five games roared 178 points, averaging 35.6 points per game. This is the answer given by curry after his injury to the tailbone, but the warriors are getting away from the playoffs.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/02/27/178%20points%20in%205%20games,%20struggling%20alone!%20Join%20James.%20You%20can't%20learn%20the%20way%20harden%20leads%20the%20team/8594cde8-fca8-4b0f-8427-82d2c5015f5d.gif" alt="178 points in 5 games, struggling alone! Join James. You can&#39;t learn the way harden leads the team"><br>The warriors have lost eight of their last 10 games, which has a lot to do with coach Cole. In the last five games, the warriors only won one game against the bucks. In that game, curry played with eight minutes left in the fourth quarter. That’s not what Cole meant. In fact, in the third or fourth quarter, curry volunteered: Steve, I want to play early, can I? Cole agreed to curry. It is precisely because of the early play of curry, during that time, ubre and curry played a wave of climax to smooth the difference, and completed the reversal at the last moment. In Cole’s dictionary, curry can only play in the last six minutes of the fourth quarter! It’s stubborn indeed. It’s the brilliant report card of warriors in the past few years that gives Cole confidence.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/02/27/178%20points%20in%205%20games,%20struggling%20alone!%20Join%20James.%20You%20can't%20learn%20the%20way%20harden%20leads%20the%20team/b097dc28-4793-4aae-bc69-4a554e7270f3.gif" alt="178 points in 5 games, struggling alone! Join James. You can&#39;t learn the way harden leads the team"><br>Curry’s core position now is more like a puppet. For example, in the last six seconds of the game, the warrior was only one point behind. The warrior stopped and Damian Lee served. After green received the ball, he passed it directly to Damian Lee. Damian Lee had already jumped to the basket and hesitated. He didn’t know whether to lay up or pass! At that moment, he was directly intercepted by afdiya, then Bill got the ball, Wiggins fouled, and bill was invincible in two free throws! What did curry do in that round? Curry goes straight behind green when he catches the ball and runs to get the defender away! If Damian Lee wants to pass the ball, he can only find Wiggins or ubre. He can’t pass it to curry behind him. In other words, curry is the victim! And in the last second of the game, Cole thought of curry, the opponent also thought of curry, so the warriors lost.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/02/27/178%20points%20in%205%20games,%20struggling%20alone!%20Join%20James.%20You%20can't%20learn%20the%20way%20harden%20leads%20the%20team/900f9375-fad1-4b40-8cb1-b8f0271fdd5a.gif" alt="178 points in 5 games, struggling alone! Join James. You can&#39;t learn the way harden leads the team"><br>Kuri really can’t learn the way harden leads the team! Before that, Durant had been injured for a long time, Owen had been on and off, and the role players around harden were not as good as Curry’s team-mates. To be honest, Wiggins’s talent, Green’s coordination, and ubre’s ability of holding the ball and attacking the basket were all very good. But harden he can connect the team, first lead the team-mates to score, when the team-mates can not break the deadlock, harden himself to come forward. Curry is limited by his physical condition. When the opponent gives him confrontational defense and makes a pinch, it’s hard for him to get the ball out! So we need green as a passing point to share the pressure of curry’s organization, while curry is looking for opportunities by running without the ball, but he can’t drive his teammates to improve. It’s hard to say which one is better, but as far as the regular season is concerned, it’s hard for harden to lead the way to the bottom of the playoffs and curry to enter the playoffs now.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/02/27/178%20points%20in%205%20games,%20struggling%20alone!%20Join%20James.%20You%20can't%20learn%20the%20way%20harden%20leads%20the%20team/fa304af8-5608-41e1-8eda-8248c3369f49.gif" alt="178 points in 5 games, struggling alone! Join James. You can&#39;t learn the way harden leads the team"><br>This summer, the warriors can renew their contract with curry ahead of time. According to the warrior reporter Slater, the warriors and curry need to think about whether they need to say goodbye. Warriors are limited by clay, green and Curry’s big contract, unable to play, they are now much more luxury tax than the nets. And curry is now at the peak, next season will change the position of ubre to clay, can the warriors from the middle and lower reaches of the western position into the top six or even the top three? It’s hard to say what state clay is in! Think of the All-Star weekend, the old Zhan to curry jokingly recruitment, now against the super Galaxy battleship nets, I’m afraid the only way to go is curry and old Zhan.</p>
