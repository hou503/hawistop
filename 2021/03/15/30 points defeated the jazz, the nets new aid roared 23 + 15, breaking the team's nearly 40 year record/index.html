The Jazz won three games in a row and the net won two games in a row.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/15/30%20points%20defeated%20the%20jazz,%20the%20nets%20new%20aid%20roared%2023%20+%2015,%20breaking%20the%20team's%20nearly%2040%20year%20record/71027d94-5fc6-48a0-b599-758e9bc95273.gif" alt="30 points defeated the jazz, the nets new aid roared 23 + 15, breaking the team&#39;s nearly 40 year record"><br>Data, the nets side, Johnson 23 points 15 rebounds 3 assists, ruwau 14 points 5 rebounds, brown 10 points 7 rebounds, chioza 10 points 11 assists, Perry 12 points 8 rebounds.

Mitchell scored three points, Conley scored three points in a row, and the Jazz easily hit a wave of 16-4 climax. In the middle of the game, Jordan helped stop the bleeding of the net, while in the second half of the game, Mitchell scored two more three points, and nion played with three points. In the first quarter, the Jazz rebounded 38-17. In the second quarter, Clarkston scored three points, green also made a layup, and the net narrowed the difference slightly. In the first five minutes, the Jazz only relied on Mitchell’s free throw to get two points. In the second half, the Jazz burst out suddenly. After Mitchell scored three points, Boyang and O’Neill continued to rain three points. Gobel and Mitchell also made a killing under the basket, and the nets collapsed completely. Only new aid Johnson played well, and was able to make a strong attack to make a killing. At the end of the half, the Jazz rebounded 63-38.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/15/30%20points%20defeated%20the%20jazz,%20the%20nets%20new%20aid%20roared%2023%20+%2015,%20breaking%20the%20team's%20nearly%2040%20year%20record/85743a47-2557-4795-aefb-c772623bfe82.gif" alt="30 points defeated the jazz, the nets new aid roared 23 + 15, breaking the team&#39;s nearly 40 year record"><br>The third quarter back, Clarkston was gobel big hat fan fly really embarrassed, Boyang even two three points, the difference has been pulled to 30 points, ruwau help the nets to stop bleeding, Mitchell led the team to play 7-0 climax again, Perry and brown continuous impact under the basket, Clarkson and Boyang continue to hit three points, the difference has gone to 40 points, and at the end of the festival, chioza and Perry continued to win Points in response to the climax of 9-2, three quarters, the Jazz 90-61 rebounds. Back in the fourth quarter, the nets only got 3 points in the first 4 minutes. Conley and nean led the team to play 9-0 again. The jazz took the lead in making personnel adjustment and directly sent the third team. However, the nets didn’t have so many people. New aid Johnson continued to use his offensive skills under the basket and cut points to help the team narrow the difference. Finally, the Jazz won the nets by 30 points at home! 88 points is also a new low for the nets this season!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/15/30%20points%20defeated%20the%20jazz,%20the%20nets%20new%20aid%20roared%2023%20+%2015,%20breaking%20the%20team's%20nearly%2040%20year%20record/38dedaec-dc48-4956-a4e4-154056bbf43a.gif" alt="30 points defeated the jazz, the nets new aid roared 23 + 15, breaking the team&#39;s nearly 40 year record"><br>Nash said in an interview before the game that harden hopes to play with injury this time, but the coaching staff refused, saying that they hope harden can learn to protect himself and come back against the pistons in the next game. It’s rare for harden to have a rest. He also prepared snacks early to watch the game. Lack of Ding Weidi + Durant + Owen + harden + Griffin + salmete + Joha, the net is not the opponent of the jazz, the first quarter of the team only one assists, played to the third quarter points difference to 38 points! This game is of little significance for the nets. To give up strategically, we must give harden a rest. This loss, on the contrary, makes the nets unload their burden. Compared with winning, health is more important.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/15/30%20points%20defeated%20the%20jazz,%20the%20nets%20new%20aid%20roared%2023%20+%2015,%20breaking%20the%20team's%20nearly%2040%20year%20record/51cd4353-8d96-4684-ba78-c0f9afff9fec.gif" alt="30 points defeated the jazz, the nets new aid roared 23 + 15, breaking the team&#39;s nearly 40 year record"><br>New recruit azley Johnson can be called the biggest surprise of the nets in this game. He grabs the rebounds in the front court, makes up the basketball with violence, including turning back and attacking hard. He has good footwork flexibility. If you give him some time, he is expected to become a member of the rotation lineup of the nets! Johnson also set a new record. He became the first player who could cut 15 + 15 in the first game in the recent 40 years! With the closing day of the trade approaching, more and more players are connected with the nets. Zhuang Shen is likely to be bought out, the next is the Lakers or the nets. Reddick may be bought out, the next family may be jazz or nets, including Raptors’ valiant Powell, nets are also very interested. In addition, Mingji revealed that if McGrady is bought by the Cavaliers, the nets are very confident to win McGrady. Nets to compete for the capital of these players is the big three, they are now the champion of the biggest popular team!</p>
