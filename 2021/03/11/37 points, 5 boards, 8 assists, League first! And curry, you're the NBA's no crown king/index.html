        <p><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/11/37%20points,%205%20boards,%208%20assists,%20League%20first!%20And%20curry,%20you're%20the%20NBA's%20no%20crown%20king/f2c6a887-e801-4710-ac3b-486beb28480f.gif" alt="37 points, 5 boards, 8 assists, League first! And curry, you&#39;re the NBA&#39;s no crown king"><br>The NBA regular season is in full swing, and the competition in the west is becoming more and more fierce. In Curry’s words, it’s too difficult to win a game. You have to do better than your opponent. In a recent game, the Blazers beat the pelicans 125-124. With six minutes left in the fourth quarter, the pelicans were 117-100 points ahead of the Blazers by 17 points. After the game, the US media gave an NBA data modeling statistics. The probability of pelicans winning was as high as 99.6%. So far this season, they are ahead of the 17 + teams in the last six minutes. Before that, they were 236-0, and the NBA was 4351-7 in the past 10 years. But Pelican lost, lost to unreasonable pioneers, lost to unreasonable Lillard! After the end of the game, Lillard quickly reached the top of the hot search first (in the United States), I just want to say: come out and see the gods.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/11/37%20points,%205%20boards,%208%20assists,%20League%20first!%20And%20curry,%20you're%20the%20NBA's%20no%20crown%20king/8e1ae4dc-fef1-4dd4-8530-7f3d7a04f259.gif" alt="37 points, 5 boards, 8 assists, League first! And curry, you&#39;re the NBA&#39;s no crown king"><br>Playing 40 minutes 36 seconds, 20 shots 13, 3 points 13 in 6, 18 free throws, 20 points in the last quarter, 50 points, 6 rebounds and 10 assists. After the end of the game, Anthony held lilard in his arms. Lilard’s face was expressionless. I think of the game in which lilard won the thunder in the summer of 18, lilard was pressed on the technical platform by many of his teammates. If he didn’t accept it, lilard was really a clean stream in the League Super Giant! In the last five games, Lillard averaged 37.4 points + 5.2 rebounds + 7.8 assists per game, averaged 36.1 minutes per game, ranked fifth in the league, scored second in the league, and hit 38.6% of the three-point ball. Lillard with this performance can compete for the best lineup, and I think the top five MVP should also have his place!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/11/37%20points,%205%20boards,%208%20assists,%20League%20first!%20And%20curry,%20you're%20the%20NBA's%20no%20crown%20king/c3bea939-fe8f-4792-be4c-dda6bd6a77c4.gif" alt="37 points, 5 boards, 8 assists, League first! And curry, you&#39;re the NBA&#39;s no crown king"><br>In an interview with O’Neill after the game, lilard talked about his idea: “there are many excellent shooters in our league. Obviously, we will think of curry at the first time. He is the greatest shooter ever, but he will do the same thing and practice a lot. No matter whether you feel tired or not, you have to improve yourself with repeated training. The time you give won’t deceive you, you should be able to throw the ball sooner or later 20 shots to get 50 points, lilard ranked third in history! Lillard achieved 16000 points and 4000 assists in the first nine seasons of his career, becoming the fourth man in the league history. The first three are Robertson, Larry Bird and James. This is also the 12th time that Lillard has scored 50 points in a single game this season, ranking seventh in the 50 + list in NBA history, equating James!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/11/37%20points,%205%20boards,%208%20assists,%20League%20first!%20And%20curry,%20you're%20the%20NBA's%20no%20crown%20king/15c72d78-df9a-43bc-9630-8183107012d0.gif" alt="37 points, 5 boards, 8 assists, League first! And curry, you&#39;re the NBA&#39;s no crown king"><br>Lillard is indeed a model of one man, one city alliance. At the beginning, Garnett said in front of the camera that loyalty is worthless in this league. But the Blazers really did the best for Lillard. In the summer of 19, the Blazers and Lillard completed a four-year $194 million contract extension ahead of schedule. Lillard can get $54.25 million in the 24-25 season. He is the first Mr. 50 million in NBA history! Speaking of his highlight performance at the critical moment, lilard said: “in junior high school, high school and University, I have to work hard silently. I know that I didn’t get the desired results without praise. I know the taste of obscurity. I have worked hard behind my back. I haven’t forgotten the roads I went through before I came here.”<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/11/37%20points,%205%20boards,%208%20assists,%20League%20first!%20And%20curry,%20you're%20the%20NBA's%20no%20crown%20king/150603fa-ac90-4d5c-b9fb-6889512abd46.gif" alt="37 points, 5 boards, 8 assists, League first! And curry, you&#39;re the NBA&#39;s no crown king"><br>In fact, Lillard really does not have any short board, excellent arm exhibition, solid basic skills in the long shot, good passing vision, and at the critical moment, he is the player who changed his life against the sky. So far this season, lilard scored 124 points at the critical moment, ranking first in the League! At the critical moment, the free throw percentage is 100%, and the league is the first! At the critical moment, the shooting percentage is 60.7%, and the three-point shooting percentage is 55.5%. He is the strongest killer in the League! After the pelican game, green tweeted: “thank you, I learned a lot from you!” Curry: “when it comes to shooters, you are also a great shooter.” The really good people, No gossip, only mutual respect and sympathy, like curry and lilard, like old Zhan and Adu.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/11/37%20points,%205%20boards,%208%20assists,%20League%20first!%20And%20curry,%20you're%20the%20NBA's%20no%20crown%20king/038eaeba-fc32-46a2-b3ea-b7a51a1f5eab.gif" alt="37 points, 5 boards, 8 assists, League first! And curry, you&#39;re the NBA&#39;s no crown king"><br>In the past few seasons, Lillard has had a love hate relationship with the warriors. He is a child from Auckland. He really wants to prove that he is not inferior to curry in front of his hometown fans in Golden State, but curry was at his best at that time, with clay and green around him, including later Durant. Curry got the regular season MVP and championship early, while lilard had nothing. But with the increase of experience and the accumulation of competition experience, lilard no longer competes with curry. When he decides to complete the nearly 200 million contract extension with the Blazers, it has been proved that he will die in the tearing city. I remember that after the west end was eliminated by the warriors, a good reporter asked lilard, why don’t you join forces to fight for the championship? Lillard replied, I know that as soon as I leave, a lot of my teammates will lose their jobs, a lot of staff will lose their jobs, and the fans will be disappointed. I won’t let that happen.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/11/37%20points,%205%20boards,%208%20assists,%20League%20first!%20And%20curry,%20you're%20the%20NBA's%20no%20crown%20king/e9eeb205-37d5-4db5-a594-21a71c0d7363.gif" alt="37 points, 5 boards, 8 assists, League first! And curry, you&#39;re the NBA&#39;s no crown king"><br>Every time James mentioned Lillard, he always spoke with a pitiful tone: “he is one of the most unrecognized and underrated players in our sport. He is a superstar in the league, he will certainly use the underestimate of the outside world as a driving force! If you give me Lillard, I’ll show you how good he is in this league Maybe we can’t wait for James and Lillard to join hands. Lillard’s career only belongs to Portland, only belongs to the pioneers. Lillard also uses another way to perform his NBA journey, even if he doesn’t have the championship, even if he doesn’t have so many personal honors, but he has achieved one person, one city, a brilliant resume, he is a kind man, he is the king of NBA!</p>
