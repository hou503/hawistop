Let&#39;s see the reality. There&#39;s only one harden in the league"><br>In the second half of the NBA regular season, there is a team in the East riding a roller coaster. After 6-17, it was 8-3 in the middle. Recently, it was a wave of 4 losses in a row! I believe many fans have guessed: the wizard. This team is really amazing. Just like their name, they can win the clippers, the Lakers and double the nets. However, when facing those opponents who are not so strong, they are in a bad state. Recently, they have been bullied by others, and no one can beat them. Is it that Wei Shao’s bad performance has delayed the team?<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/23/27%20points,%2012%20assists,%201-5%20is%20rejected!%20Let's%20see%20the%20reality.%20There's%20only%20one%20harden%20in%20the%20league/fca5d574-5b5b-4fcd-8e49-9351374670e6.gif" alt="27 points, 12 assists, 1-5 is rejected! Let&#39;s see the reality. There&#39;s only one harden in the league"><br>In the last six games, the wizards are 1-5, with average 26.6 points, 6.6 rebounds and 12.1 assists per game. Because of this wave of consecutive losses, the Wizards fell to the 12th in the East. Like the rotten Cavaliers, they are three wins away from the tenth place Pacers. They want to meet the nets in the playoffs, at least to advance the playoffs, at least to play to the 10th playoff qualification line, but with their current strength and state, I’m afraid they will be brushed down ahead of time. First of all, we can be sure that it has nothing to do with Wei Shao. Wei Shao tried his best and was rejected in the end! According to Katz and Aldrich of the Olympic, several sources revealed that the Wizards didn’t contact teams who wanted to trade bill, and Bill didn’t apply for a deal himself.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/23/27%20points,%2012%20assists,%201-5%20is%20rejected!%20Let's%20see%20the%20reality.%20There's%20only%20one%20harden%20in%20the%20league/d1203414-bb62-47bf-9768-04dc45b8f46c.gif" alt="27 points, 12 assists, 1-5 is rejected! Let&#39;s see the reality. There&#39;s only one harden in the league"><br>It’s very interesting here. From the beginning of the season, when Williams’ performance was very low, there was news that bill might leave the wizard, because the whole team of the wizard was dragging bill down. When the news was revealed again, Williams must be the most injured one, because he was not questioned by the media and fans for the first time. But Wei Shao’s performance really does not have any slot! Before that, Wei Shao played 33 minutes, 10 in 19, got 25 points, 5 rebounds and 8 assists, but Bill was in the doldrums, and the wizards were defeated by 26 points! Bill got a total of 32 points and 6 assists in the last 12 minutes, and then went on to play with Qi Wei.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/23/27%20points,%2012%20assists,%201-5%20is%20rejected!%20Let's%20see%20the%20reality.%20There's%20only%20one%20harden%20in%20the%20league/c154c53c-17d8-4053-8858-18f7a6c1bc0c.gif" alt="27 points, 12 assists, 1-5 is rejected! Let&#39;s see the reality. There&#39;s only one harden in the league"><br>Two days later, he played for the second time against the bucks. Wei Shao played for 39 minutes, 8 in 19, got 23 points, 17 assists, 5 rebounds, and 3 in 6 three-point shots. He was the most accurate player for the wizard in the last six games, but the wizard completely defeated the Bucks! Weishao’s 17 assists is a new high after joining the wizard. Weishao can get 40 + triple doubles in both teams. Only Chamberlain has done it before in NBA history! Willis became the third player in history to unlock 21000 points, 6000 rebounds and 7000 assists after Robertson and James! For Wei Shao who is not good at projection, for Wei Shao whose physical condition has obviously declined, this is all he can contribute. Do you want him to do more? For example, 30 + triple doubles per field? Neville won’t be a wizard. He was robbed by the clipper long ago.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/23/27%20points,%2012%20assists,%201-5%20is%20rejected!%20Let's%20see%20the%20reality.%20There's%20only%20one%20harden%20in%20the%20league/c68cccf6-a871-4088-bc0f-4e468f8da995.gif" alt="27 points, 12 assists, 1-5 is rejected! Let&#39;s see the reality. There&#39;s only one harden in the league"><br>From January to March last year, more than 50 days before the end of the epidemic, harden was in a low state, but weishao was in a hot state, averaging 31 + 7 + 8 per game, climbing all the way with the Rockets. In many games, harden scored more than 10 or 20 points, but weishao scored 35-40 points, and the Rockets won easily. Why can’t he go to the wizard? There are two reasons. First, after all, bill is not harden. The common feature of bill and harden is that they stack up a large number of shots to get high scores. However, Bill’s three-point hit rate is very low, only 33.6%. His real hit rate is in the middle and lower reaches of the league. When Williams is the team organizer, bill can’t play the role of pitcher. Second, the wizard is too bad. There used to be a center Bryant. Since Bryant’s season reimbursement, only bamun can score. To put it mildly, the level of other players is similar to that of the Rockets.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/23/27%20points,%2012%20assists,%201-5%20is%20rejected!%20Let's%20see%20the%20reality.%20There's%20only%20one%20harden%20in%20the%20league/241f09b9-b2bc-49ca-8777-4bfb551bbd4e.gif" alt="27 points, 12 assists, 1-5 is rejected! Let&#39;s see the reality. There&#39;s only one harden in the league"><br>After the Nets beat the Knicks, harden posted a picture and an essay on the social platform: “Brooklyn, my home!” Wei Shao praised it for the first time. There was no conflict between them in private. When harden decided to leave the Rockets, he was the first to tell Wei Shao that he wanted to follow Durant and join the nets. After that, Wei Shao offered to trade and leave the Rockets, which was interpreted by the media and fans as a quarrel with harden. In fact, harden is not wrong. He can’t see the hope of winning the championship in the Rockets’ eight years. Now he only wants to win the championship. He even directly rejected the Rockets’ two-year $100 million contract extension. And Wei Shao is not wrong. After leaving thunder, he is no longer the boss of the team, and he no longer has the right to speak and decide in the dressing room. So he can simply find a team that can make him play happily, even if he may not win the championship in his career.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/23/27%20points,%2012%20assists,%201-5%20is%20rejected!%20Let's%20see%20the%20reality.%20There's%20only%20one%20harden%20in%20the%20league/7208b05a-764e-42e9-8a86-cc483a32f3f4.gif" alt="27 points, 12 assists, 1-5 is rejected! Let&#39;s see the reality. There&#39;s only one harden in the league"><br>Maybe the Wizards didn’t want to play in the playoffs when they traded weishao, they just wanted to get rid of the burden of wall as soon as possible. Bill, he’s just a scorer with a high percentage of ball power. At the beginning, Wei Shao wanted to break away from the rocket and go to his mentor Brooks. He may think that bill is the next harden. With him and bill, the wizard will soar in the East. Unfortunately, not every partner is harden. Unfortunately, the former partner now follows his former partner. Poor Wei Shao is replaced by Owen.</p>
