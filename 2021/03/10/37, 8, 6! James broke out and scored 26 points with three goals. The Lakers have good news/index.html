Under the leadership of James, they won four consecutive games!

James broke out and scored 26 points with three goals. The Lakers have good news"><br>In the first quarter, Bauer steals James, and Rozier counterattacks to break the deadlock. After that, James scores three points and attacks the basket continuously. The Hornets rely on Washington and Bauer to lead the team to seize the score. In the second half of the game, the Hornets fell into scoring shortage. Under the leadership of Kuzma and Schroeder, the Los Angeles Lakers gradually opened the gap, leading the Hornets 31-24 in the first quarter. Back in the second quarter, Washington and Graham chased for 5 points in a row. At the critical moment, James stepped forward and united with Harrell to respond with 8 points to widen the difference again. Midcourse Hornets into scoring shortage, Matthews and Kuzma hit three points in a row, the Lakers will open the difference to 18 points. In the second half, the Hornets rely on Washington and Rozier to continue to attack the interior, responding to a wave of 12-4 climax. James came back with three points, followed by a layup at the whistle, and the Lakers were 60-45 ahead of the Hornets at half-time.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/10/37,%208,%206!%20James%20broke%20out%20and%20scored%2026%20points%20with%20three%20goals.%20The%20Lakers%20have%20good%20news/811bd7f7-f532-4f45-ba22-c432ec402043.gif" alt="37, 8, 6! James broke out and scored 26 points with three goals. The Lakers have good news"><br>The third quarter back, the Hornets began to work, Hayward’s 2 + 1, Rozier and bridges breakthrough, the Hornets will narrow the difference to single digits, James even took 4 points to stop bleeding, the Hornets rely on Rozier, Washington and Bauer to score three points, the Hornets a wave of 12-2 climax directly smooth the difference. At the critical moment, Kuzma became James’s helper and responded to two three-point goals in a row. At the end of the quarter, Graham and Washington continued to shoot three points, while Tucker and Harrell kept the lead in a row by attacking the box. The Lakers finished 83-79 in three quarters, leading the Hornets by four points. In the fourth quarter, Schroeder scored another three points, but Rozier and Bauer scored three minutes to level the difference again. In the middle of the game, Schroeder and James blossomed in a row on the outside line. Bauer even scored 5 points to keep the Hornets’ hope. However, James and Schroeder continued to attack the basket, and Popper made a layup to lock in the victory. The Lakers narrowly defeated the Hornets and won four games in a row.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/10/37,%208,%206!%20James%20broke%20out%20and%20scored%2026%20points%20with%20three%20goals.%20The%20Lakers%20have%20good%20news/2280923d-ad15-4e41-a935-67643d26a1ca.gif" alt="37, 8, 6! James broke out and scored 26 points with three goals. The Lakers have good news"><br>In this game, when Schroeder was present, the record of the Lakers was 7-2, while Schroeder was absent, the record of the Lakers was 0-4. In fact, Davis’s absence is not a fatal blow to the Lakers, but James must need a ball holder to share the pressure. Schroeder can play the offensive strength of breakthrough with the ball, and also feed Kuzma, Harrell and tucker. Schroeder is gradually integrating into the system of the Lakers, which is a good thing. The Lakers need to give the new players time to adapt. For James, the recent performance is too eye-catching. In the past three games, James averaged 28 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists per game, with a shooting percentage of 61.2% and a three-point shooting percentage of 50%?<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/10/37,%208,%206!%20James%20broke%20out%20and%20scored%2026%20points%20with%20three%20goals.%20The%20Lakers%20have%20good%20news/c13715c7-ce94-444a-882e-8f7c7cc5ecf3.gif" alt="37, 8, 6! James broke out and scored 26 points with three goals. The Lakers have good news"><br>There is still good news after the Lakers win. The Jazz lost to the Wizards today, and Williams and bill led the team to complete the reversal. In addition, the Suns lost to the wolves at the bottom of the league. Downes and Edwards scored 83 points. Edwards broke five records in the first World War. The reason why the Suns collapsed in the fourth quarter was very simple. Paul and Booker were defeated by Edwards. The two major competitors lost at the same time. The Lakers not only surpassed the Suns to the second place in the west, but also were only 1.5 games away from the jazz. In addition, the Lakers had 2.5 games away from the Clippers! Now the jazz has become the public enemy of the league, and the Lakers are in an invincible position. Davis can be at ease to recover. He is looking forward to Kuzma, Harrell and Schroeder playing more steadily!</p>
