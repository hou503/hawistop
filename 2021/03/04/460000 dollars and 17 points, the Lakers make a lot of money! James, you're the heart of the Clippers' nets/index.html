        <p>After the Lakers won the championship last season, many teams launched an arms race this season. The purpose is simple and direct, that is to defeat James and the powerful Lakers. The super luxury warship represented by the basketball net came into being. It is a multi giant combination of Owen + harden + Durant + Adelaide + Griffin. To be honest, the paper strength is indeed better than that of the Lakers. However, in the latest confrontation, the Lakers gave up a starting lineup, the basketball net gave up harden, but the basketball net fell down here, a 25 point fiasco! Su Qun said that the referee’s decisions on Owen and Schroeder influenced the wonderful game. After the game, Zhuang Shen became a great hero of the team, but everyone ignored an unknown hero, who even got 14 points in the net!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/04/460000%20dollars%20and%2017%20points,%20the%20Lakers%20make%20a%20lot%20of%20money!%20James,%20you're%20the%20heart%20of%20the%20Clippers'%20nets/50279884-701c-4ae1-b9e7-fdd68c06a2c4.gif" alt="460000 dollars and 17 points, the Lakers make a lot of money! James, you&#39;re the heart of the Clippers&#39; nets"><br>On April 3, chalania reported that the Rockets are expected to cut mcclemo, the purpose is very simple, the team is now rebuilding, don’t need him, cut him can save part of the salary, the two sides break up friendly and peaceful. After the news of mcclemo’s dismissal came out, four or five teams expressed their strong interest in him at the first time. This season, mcclemo played 32 games on behalf of the Rockets, averaging 7.4 points + 2.1 rebounds per game, and the three-point shooting rate was only 33.1%. It’s not surprising that he had his last time compressed, his shots were reduced, and there was no teammate around to pull space for him. He wanted to score It’s too hard. After the Rockets officially cut mcclemo, after the clarification period, mcclemo announced to join the Lakers!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/04/460000%20dollars%20and%2017%20points,%20the%20Lakers%20make%20a%20lot%20of%20money!%20James,%20you're%20the%20heart%20of%20the%20Clippers'%20nets/0725c1fa-d01f-41df-8292-eccc2bc516ba.gif" alt="460000 dollars and 17 points, the Lakers make a lot of money! James, you&#39;re the heart of the Clippers&#39; nets"><br>According to the analysis of salary expert Bob marks, from the time the Lakers signed mcclemo to the end of the season, they only need to give him $455000. The Lakers have 500000 left from the hard salary cap, so they can continue to recruit. And the Lakers can not get mcclemo without the help of Richie Paul, because mcclemo is also a member of Richie Paul’s agency. He’s perfect for the Lakers for two reasons: first, mcclemo can shoot three points; second, mcclemo can shoot three points. According to the data, mcclemo shot 10.1 three-point shots every 36 minutes last season, while Kuzma, who has the most three-point shots this season, shot 7.1 three-point shots every 36 minutes. It is commendable that mcclemo can maintain a stable shooting rate, which is the fundamental reason for the Lakers to recruit him.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/04/460000%20dollars%20and%2017%20points,%20the%20Lakers%20make%20a%20lot%20of%20money!%20James,%20you're%20the%20heart%20of%20the%20Clippers'%20nets/61dfdc77-b461-4368-85ed-1f0064cdfbb6.gif" alt="460000 dollars and 17 points, the Lakers make a lot of money! James, you&#39;re the heart of the Clippers&#39; nets"><br>Mclermo was the most accurate outside shooter of the Rockets last season, averaging 10.1 points, 2.6 3-point shots per game, with a 3-point shooting rate of 40%. In the past four seasons, mclermo’s average 3-point shooting rate has reached 38.5%! Mcclemo is different from any other player in the current Lakers. Mcclemo belongs to a more retro type of projection, similar to the original Ray Allen and kovar. He can jump shot, jump immediately at the moment of catching the ball, ignore the incoming defender, and use the vertical height to create projection space, while Caruso, pop, Matthews and Kuzma all receive the ball after adjustment The effect is often not very good. In mcclemo’s own words, as long as he gets the first shot in the game, he believes he will always hit three points. This kind of shooter is really not good at defense, because he can shoot three points against the defender, his sense of rhythm is faster, and it is difficult for the opponent to defend in advance.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/04/460000%20dollars%20and%2017%20points,%20the%20Lakers%20make%20a%20lot%20of%20money!%20James,%20you're%20the%20heart%20of%20the%20Clippers'%20nets/0cc4c786-1b55-46aa-b74c-76bb7e5cb651.gif" alt="460000 dollars and 17 points, the Lakers make a lot of money! James, you&#39;re the heart of the Clippers&#39; nets"><br>In the first game of joining the Lakers, mcclemo played for 17 minutes, and Tucker, Caruso and Blackie were all creating shooting opportunities for him. Unfortunately, mcclemo came to the team in a hurry, didn’t practice together, and his body was not at the best level. He was 1 in 4 of the game, with 3 in 0. In the game with the nets, mcclemo played 23 minutes, 6 of 12, 5 of 10 three-point shots, and got 17 points in total. In the 8 minutes at the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth quarter, he made 4 three-point shots and 1 high jump shot, leading the team to resist the rebound momentum of the nets, and completely wasted the game! After the game, including Maurice and Zhuang Shen, they praised mclemo, while mclemo himself was shy and said that his teammates on the bench had been shouting to him: “keep shooting!” He likes the atmosphere.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/04/460000%20dollars%20and%2017%20points,%20the%20Lakers%20make%20a%20lot%20of%20money!%20James,%20you're%20the%20heart%20of%20the%20Clippers'%20nets/f93ecc0a-ae0a-41a1-91b2-48e7da7009dc.gif" alt="460000 dollars and 17 points, the Lakers make a lot of money! James, you&#39;re the heart of the Clippers&#39; nets"><br>The Laker bench is a gathering of four big guys: Jen, Davis, Kuzma and Gareth. In the last two games, mcclemo got the second shot in the team’s offense, which was 16 points in the last two games! When the official media of the Lakers released the video highlights of mcclemo, Jen was even more excited to forward: “he will be noticed by more people!” Mcclemo is Ray Allen around Jen in the heat period and Kovar around Jen in the Cavaliers period. He may not need to break out every game, but with James, mcclemo will be able to help him at the critical moment. This is the confidence of the shooter. I believe that after Jen’s return, mclemo will play better.</p>
