        <p>On March 22, Beijing time, the NBA regular season continued, with the pioneers at home against the lone ranger. Previously, the Trail Blazers ranked fifth in the western region with a 25-16 record, and the lone ranger ranked eighth with a 21-19 record. In the first three games of the season, the Blazers kept winning all over the lone ranger, but this game is totally different! In the first quarter, the pioneers took the lead slightly. From the second quarter, the pioneers were completely crushed, and the lone ranger was 43 points ahead of the pioneers in the fourth quarter! The final score is not any suspense, the Blazers home 92-132 defeat lone ranger, the Blazers end three wins in a row, the Clippers hold the fourth position in the West.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/07/40%20points!%20Double%20shot%20only%2032%20points,%20East%20Qi%20big%20outbreak%20revenge%20success,%20the%20Clippers%20take%20advantage/3165e2f0-08c1-4be4-9499-fb7e2aa778dc.gif" alt="40 points!

On the Blazers’ side, lilard has 19 points and 4 assists, mclarm has 13 points, Anthony has 6 points and 2 rebounds, and Trent has 16 points.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/07/40%20points!%20Double%20shot%20only%2032%20points,%20East%20Qi%20big%20outbreak%20revenge%20success,%20the%20Clippers%20take%20advantage/ddb6e8b7-b1bd-4a54-a4d1-b3d0369d9dfb.gif" alt="40 points! Double shot only 32 points, East Qi big outbreak revenge success, the Clippers take advantage"><br>At the beginning of the game, Dong Qiqi made a foul, and mcclem scored four points under the basket in a row. After Poseidon scored three points, Jones and Covington made a continuous breakthrough to kill. The lone ranger responded with six points under the leadership of Dong Qiqi. Little hadawei was dissatisfied with the penalty, and Dong Qiqi continued to shoot three points. At the end of the festival, lilard lay up to help the team take the lead. In the first quarter, the pioneers were 30-27 lone Rangers. After coming back in the second quarter, Dong Qiqi succeeded in a series of back singles. After the lone ranger overtook the Trail Blazers, Trent responded with three points. The two teams fell into a stalemate. In the middle, the Trail Blazers’ hit rate dropped. Richardson and Dong Qiqi scored seven points in a row. After Anthony stopped the lay up, Poshen responded with a series of strong attacks. At the end of the quarter, Fanny Smith scored another three points. At the end of the half, the lone ranger 65-54 Trail Blazers.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/07/40%20points!%20Double%20shot%20only%2032%20points,%20East%20Qi%20big%20outbreak%20revenge%20success,%20the%20Clippers%20take%20advantage/109650c6-77d4-4d13-a4aa-ade3c9867240.gif" alt="40 points! Double shot only 32 points, East Qi big outbreak revenge success, the Clippers take advantage"><br>In the third quarter, Kleber got 5 points in a row, and Dong Qiqi scored two more three-point goals. After a wave of 11-0, the difference widened to 20 points. The Blazers lilard and mcclem continued to play iron. Dong Qiqi led the team to continue to expand the difference. In the first half of the quarter, the Blazers didn’t score. Mcclem finished 2 + 1 layup to break the deadlock, while Dong Qiqi’s three-point goal was in vain, and Richardson and little Hadaway continued to attack the basket , break through 30 points, finish three quarters, lone ranger 103-69 pioneer. In the fourth quarter, because the difference between the two teams is too big, the two teams tacitly put on the third team, the pioneers still have no feeling. The lone ranger under the leadership of Powell pulled the difference to more than 40 points. In the middle of the game, little and Trent finally began to fight back, but the efficiency was not high. In the end, the lone ranger beat the pioneers by 40 points.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/07/40%20points!%20Double%20shot%20only%2032%20points,%20East%20Qi%20big%20outbreak%20revenge%20success,%20the%20Clippers%20take%20advantage/533eec03-46b2-47de-9b91-ca8661ab7f08.gif" alt="40 points! Double shot only 32 points, East Qi big outbreak revenge success, the Clippers take advantage"><br>This game, Dong Qiqi from the first quarter of the fire open, the first half of 14 in 9, including three-point ball 4 in 4, shot down 24 points 4 rebounds 2 assists, this is his third game in a row, half-time to get 20 +, equalizing the longest personal career record. As a matter of fact, the lone ranger can not provide much help to Dong Qiqi’s stability in the current array. The performance of Poshen is disappointing and gradually becomes mediocre. In this case, Dong Qiqi puts the score in the first place. In addition, the lone ranger also reaps good news. The Knights are eager to get rid of Zhuang Shen, and their asking price is not high. A second round draw. At present, the lone ranger is on the way out and has discussed with the knight about the details of trading Zhuang Shen. If the lone ranger gets Zhuang Shen, their attack and defense performance can be improved.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/07/40%20points!%20Double%20shot%20only%2032%20points,%20East%20Qi%20big%20outbreak%20revenge%20success,%20the%20Clippers%20take%20advantage/19f6597c-48e9-4391-babe-887a34da25b1.gif" alt="40 points! Double shot only 32 points, East Qi big outbreak revenge success, the Clippers take advantage"><br>It’s no surprise that the Trail Blazers suffered a disastrous defeat. Recently, their schedule has been very difficult. From the 19th to the 27th, they have to play six games in these nine days, and they have to alternate home and away games. In the last back-to-back defeat of the lone ranger, mcclem gritted his teeth and insisted. In this game, lilard and mcclem had no outside touch at all. In addition, they were unable to effectively complete the guard frame, which led to the blooming of the lone ranger inside and outside. In fact, the strength gap between the two sides was not so big. Go on, the next rebound is waiting for them.</p>
