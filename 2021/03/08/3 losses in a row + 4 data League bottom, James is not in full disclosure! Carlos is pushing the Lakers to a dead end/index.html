Carlos is pushing the Lakers to a dead end"><br>In the face of pelican, No. 11 in the Western Conference, and the lack of James and Davis, the Lakers didn’t have any power to fight back. They lost 111-128. It’s true that it’s hard to live without two big stars, unless you still have a harden in your team. Unfortunately, the Lakers don’t have harden, only pop who has completely lost his confidence, Schroeder who has been infinitely targeted, and Caruso who has not made much contribution to the offensive. After losing three times in a row, the Lakers are 28-16, ranking fourth in the West. But look carefully, the Lakers are only 2.5 games ahead of the sixth place blazers and 6 games ahead of the tenth place Grizzlies! Ideally, the Lakers keep the top six, the worst plan, may not keep the top ten.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/08/3%20losses%20in%20a%20row%20+%204%20data%20League%20bottom,%20James%20is%20not%20in%20full%20disclosure!%20Carlos%20is%20pushing%20the%20Lakers%20to%20a%20dead%20end/726350b8-d3e9-4158-b19e-bbb13fad5eeb.gif" alt="3 losses in a row + 4 data League bottom, James is not in full disclosure! Carlos is pushing the Lakers to a dead end"><br>In the past three games, the data of the Lakers are at the bottom of the league. Average 99.7 points per game, average 35 shots per game, offensive efficiency 100.7, shooting rate 41.8%, in other words, even if the Lakers defense to the extreme, but you don’t score offensive end, you still can’t win. Lose hawks, lose suns, lose pelicans, in fact, the overall strength of these three opponents is stronger than suns, the other two teams, let the Lakers show the original shape! What kind of team is the Lakers? Zhan Mei was present at the same time, winning 14.7 points in 100 rounds, James was present, and Nongmei was not present. He won 7.0 points in 100 rounds, James was not present, and Nongmei was present. He lost 3.7 points in 100 rounds. Zhan Mei was not present, and he lost 5.3 points in 100 rounds. Conclusion: without James, this is a league 20-25th team, similar to the wizards and thunder.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/08/3%20losses%20in%20a%20row%20+%204%20data%20League%20bottom,%20James%20is%20not%20in%20full%20disclosure!%20Carlos%20is%20pushing%20the%20Lakers%20to%20a%20dead%20end/1a30c156-5200-45fe-804b-a931d9e5b98e.gif" alt="3 losses in a row + 4 data League bottom, James is not in full disclosure! Carlos is pushing the Lakers to a dead end"><br>What should I do? Is it hard to make the same mistake again? In 19, James suffered from a groin injury, and the Lakers directly ranked out of ten from the fourth place in the West. They lost to Ingram and the ball brother. They doubted their lives. Then they came to New Orleans. Ingram said: at that time, they had to face all kinds of accusations and insults when they lost a game. It was too painful. In fact, James’ team can never be separated from James. Because of the system, because of his value on the court, and the control of the game at both ends of attack and defense, no one can replace James. The latest news, Davis will review around the 27th, even if recovered, to play, may have to play before one or two weeks time limit. And the reality is, only Davis, 100 rounds or lose points! When will Lao Zhan come back?<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/08/3%20losses%20in%20a%20row%20+%204%20data%20League%20bottom,%20James%20is%20not%20in%20full%20disclosure!%20Carlos%20is%20pushing%20the%20Lakers%20to%20a%20dead%20end/d81699cd-5358-436a-9603-a4ddf9f52ea0.gif" alt="3 losses in a row + 4 data League bottom, James is not in full disclosure! Carlos is pushing the Lakers to a dead end"><br>James will always be there when he is injured. He doesn’t like being injured and can’t play with his teammates. He will return to the team as soon as possible. But his ankle high sprain, but a big hidden trouble. The recovery cycle given by the Lakers is 3-4 weeks, while the famous player wenderhorst said that it may be longer, which is based on the smooth progress of James’ recovery and needs to try a lot of methods. Of course, fortunately, I didn’t hurt my Achilles tendon! Let’s say that the Lakers have 15 games to watch, and James has one and a half to watch! In addition, the 76ers, the Bucks, the clippers, the nets, the green army and the jazz all happened to be waiting for the Lakers in this period of time! Assuming that without Jensen, the winning rate of the Lakers will remain at about 30%, which means that after Jensen comes back, the record of the Lakers will be about 30-29.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/08/3%20losses%20in%20a%20row%20+%204%20data%20League%20bottom,%20James%20is%20not%20in%20full%20disclosure!%20Carlos%20is%20pushing%20the%20Lakers%20to%20a%20dead%20end/41d2a70d-44eb-45b3-a4aa-4fae4ec4af47.gif" alt="3 losses in a row + 4 data League bottom, James is not in full disclosure! Carlos is pushing the Lakers to a dead end"><br>With a 50% winning rate, the Western Conference will definitely not be able to enter the top six. Now the ninth and tenth Grizzlies have a winning rate of just over 50%. In other words, if the Lakers want to stay in the top ten and hold the qualification of the playoffs, they have to win at least two or three opponents in the next game. In this case, after Jen comes back, there are about 12 games left. If the Lakers want to catch up, they don’t have to play a playoff when they reach the top six. How difficult is it? Of course, the Lakers will never lose in a row. After all, Davis is likely to come back in the middle of the game, and little Gasol is also expected to play when he recovers. There will always be a burst of role players in the Lakers. But to be honest, this season is even more dangerous than that of 19 years, because the Lakers are a team that has just won the championship and removed the skeleton. If their goal is to defend the title, then Davis and Harrell will be the best What is the degree of tacit understanding including Schroeder?<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/08/3%20losses%20in%20a%20row%20+%204%20data%20League%20bottom,%20James%20is%20not%20in%20full%20disclosure!%20Carlos%20is%20pushing%20the%20Lakers%20to%20a%20dead%20end/64773107-e824-4003-afba-89828fcce447.gif" alt="3 losses in a row + 4 data League bottom, James is not in full disclosure! Carlos is pushing the Lakers to a dead end"><br>James is not here. It’s all out. To tell you the truth, it’s really hard for the Lakers to strengthen through a big deal. Schroeder is recognized by the Lakers as the future core guard of the team and can help James share the pressure. Although Pop has been sleepwalking, but he is an important part of the Laker’s outside, defensive top, the most accurate shooter outside. Including Harrell, he can bring more flexibility to the Laker lineup, and his offensive ability is also urgently needed by the Laker. Who can the Lakers play? If we trade players like Tucker and Caruso, who can we get? The Lakers are now waiting for Zhuang Shen to take the initiative to bite the hook, there is no other way, the biggest advantage of the Lakers is James and thick eyebrow. Of course, if the Lakers really send off pop, Harrell and Schroeder before the trade deadline, palinka will slap himself in the face, because he let go too much credit in order to get them at the beginning!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/08/3%20losses%20in%20a%20row%20+%204%20data%20League%20bottom,%20James%20is%20not%20in%20full%20disclosure!%20Carlos%20is%20pushing%20the%20Lakers%20to%20a%20dead%20end/293ed02a-a928-49d5-8955-faabd18e9b60.gif" alt="3 losses in a row + 4 data League bottom, James is not in full disclosure! Carlos is pushing the Lakers to a dead end"><br>In fact, I believe the Laker fans can understand that palinka, the Laker won the championship last season, did not encounter the Clippers factor. The Clippers are also one of the biggest competitors for the Lakers. When Harrell tries free market, the Lakers won’t wait to die. When the Lakers have a chance to find a point guard for James, they will fight for it. The Clippers led by Leonard and George, their strongest lineup: Beverly + George + Cary + Morris + Ibaka, is indeed impeccable, the Lakers need to supplement James and Davis, the lineup last season, the Lakers may not be able to pass this pass. The management tried their best, but they didn’t expect Davis to be a Glassman. They didn’t expect James to fall too! Next, the Lakers need to go through the darkest days.</p>
