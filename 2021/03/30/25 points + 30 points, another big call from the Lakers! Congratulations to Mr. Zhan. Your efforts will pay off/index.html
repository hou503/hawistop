        <p>It’s almost two weeks since James was injured in the game against the Hawks on March 21. The Lakers have played eight games during this period, 3-5. The record is not good, but there is one thing to be sure: they hold the fourth position in the West! In other words, they are likely to be in the top six in the west when Jamie returns! In the last game, the Lakers beat Sacramento 115-94. I remember in the last game before the all star weekend, the Lakers also lacked Jamie and lost three points against Sacramento. Good bye, 21 points, that’s progress! 25 points + 30 points, another big Laker rebounded, James’s hard work also paid off.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/30/25%20points%20+%2030%20points,%20another%20big%20call%20from%20the%20Lakers!%20Congratulations%20to%20Mr.%20Zhan.%20Your%20efforts%20will%20pay%20off/92c3fca8-cdc1-4b61-9912-6b5ff4e69e68.gif" alt="25 points + 30 points, another big call from the Lakers! Congratulations to Mr. Zhan. Your efforts will pay off"><br>Speaking of the meritorious player of the Lakers, we must mention Kuzma. In fact, Kuzma’s tactical position and shooting power have been seriously weakened this season. He is only the fifth scoring point after James, Davis, Schroeder and Harrell. Before the start of the new season, the Lakers and Kuzma completed a three-year $40 million contract extension. In fact, this contract extension is a little low for Kuzma. Former team mate Ingram had a top salary of 150 million in pelicans, and his three-year contract was less than a fraction of his. The Lakers do want to keep Kuzma, and three years of $40 million is the largest contract the Lakers can offer. What does Kuzma mean to the Lakers? In the past three years, the inheritance of the Lakers, including the important role player beside Jamie when the Lakers won the championship last season, he is also the core of the Lakers.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/30/25%20points%20+%2030%20points,%20another%20big%20call%20from%20the%20Lakers!%20Congratulations%20to%20Mr.%20Zhan.%20Your%20efforts%20will%20pay%20off/e4554019-f702-40e3-b8b2-52e207f66d1a.gif" alt="25 points + 30 points, another big call from the Lakers! Congratulations to Mr. Zhan. Your efforts will pay off"><br>In the game against the 76ers, Kuzma played 42 minutes, 9 in 21, got 25 points and 9 rebounds, leading the Lakers to seize the score. Although he lost in the end, every player of the Lakers tried his best. Kuzma went to defend Harris, who was bigger than him, to rush for rebounds, and to carry out high-level pick and roll for Schroeder. In the game with king, Kuzma played 36 minutes, 11 in 18, got 30 points, 5 rebounds, 3 assists, three points at the top of the arc, low back singles, empty cut dunk, including feeding cake to Caruso and Harrell. After the game, Kuzma burst out: “I told myself, never be a XX like before, I’m what I’m focusing on, and that’s the important reason why I stay here, I’m not here I want to continue to learn more from great players<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/30/25%20points%20+%2030%20points,%20another%20big%20call%20from%20the%20Lakers!%20Congratulations%20to%20Mr.%20Zhan.%20Your%20efforts%20will%20pay%20off/d27c5663-5750-434a-99e1-73fbb04dd4cc.gif" alt="25 points + 30 points, another big call from the Lakers! Congratulations to Mr. Zhan. Your efforts will pay off"><br>In fact, Kuzma is really suitable to play the leader of this team. When Davis was absent and Jen was leading the team for four consecutive defeats, all doubts were directed at Jen. Only Kuzma was willing to take the responsibility, saying that everyone had a lot of shortcomings. As a team attacking the championship, it should not be such a rubbish performance. When Jen was injured, Kuzma was still speaking as a leader: This is a big challenge. We don’t have to think about LeBron and Anthony now. We just fasten our shoelaces and run forward. We have to play team first! Compared with last season, Kuzma’s average score per game has not changed, but the shooting percentage + three-point shooting percentage + rebounds + assists + blocks and other data have been improved comprehensively. What’s most gratifying is that Kuzma’s defensive efficiency is among the top 20 in the league, and the Lakers are second only to Caruso and James!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/30/25%20points%20+%2030%20points,%20another%20big%20call%20from%20the%20Lakers!%20Congratulations%20to%20Mr.%20Zhan.%20Your%20efforts%20will%20pay%20off/443732cd-39d9-439c-bbb4-c474c744d867.gif" alt="25 points + 30 points, another big call from the Lakers! Congratulations to Mr. Zhan. Your efforts will pay off"><br>When Durant is absent, Owen stops and starts, and harden takes the role of basketball net player all the way to the first place in the East, all the media and fans think that the basketball net will win the championship without any suspense this season. But if you remember the way the Lakers won the championship last season, you will know that the nets want to easily win the championship is not easy! The playoffs will never be the duel of superstar 1v1, or the comprehensive combat effectiveness accumulated by simple giants. Super giant must have excellent role players around him. The nets are doing very well now. Under the leadership of harden, they have cultivated many valiant players. Jeff Green, Zhao Si, brown, including Griffin and Adelaide, are all plug and play. Kuzma in the absence of Zhan Mei, he used his own actions to rebound, win the championship, is never a matter of one or several people, but the team and team game.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/30/25%20points%20+%2030%20points,%20another%20big%20call%20from%20the%20Lakers!%20Congratulations%20to%20Mr.%20Zhan.%20Your%20efforts%20will%20pay%20off/020ac197-91ea-4f04-a3b3-1d408c8ec529.gif" alt="25 points + 30 points, another big call from the Lakers! Congratulations to Mr. Zhan. Your efforts will pay off"><br>Congratulations to James, your hard work has finally paid off! This season, the Lakers was the best time for James to support Davis. Unfortunately, Davis was absent for a long time due to injury. James can still contribute 25 + 8 + 8 per game with his physical condition and impact. In some games, he even has to cut 40 + and 30 + triple doubles in order to win, but this way of winning is not conducive to the growth and progress of the team. There must be role players who stand up and learn to bear the burden of the game, like Kuzma, who is willing to be a leader to work hard and fight. At least Kuzma’s performance has not let the Laker fans and Jen down. Who else says Kuzma is a vase?</p>
