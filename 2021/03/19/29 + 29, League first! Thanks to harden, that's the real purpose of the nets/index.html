        <p>League 30 teams, more than 450 players, each season only one team can get the championship, only a dozen players can get the championship ring, how cruel! Some players may struggle all their lives and can’t touch the championship trophy. Of course, there are also some lucky people, such as McCullough, Denny green and McKee, who are just regular champions and bring their own lucky buffs. But there are very few such players. In the final analysis, they speak by strength! After the Lakers won the championship last year, they accelerated the arms race between the giants. This season, the nets have sprung up in the East. To be honest, if harden doesn’t come to the nets, will adelain and Griffin come in the future? This is actually Schrodinger’s law, but thanks to harden.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/19/29%20+%2029,%20League%20first!%20Thanks%20to%20harden,%20that's%20the%20real%20purpose%20of%20the%20nets/02e07f79-f96f-4c49-8e96-99761fa27514.gif" alt="29 + 29, League first! Thanks to harden, that&#39;s the real purpose of the nets"><br>Since Durant suffered a hamstring injury in the game against warriors on February 14, he has won 16-3 in 19 games without Durant, ranking first in the league in the same period! During this period, harden played 18 games, averaging 29.2 points + 9.7 rebounds + 11.2 assists. Owen played 13 games, averaging 28.7 points + 5.1 rebounds + 5.6 assists. Harden Owen is also the most powerful duo in the league. The nets are terrible now: the best scorer is Durant, Owen has 30 + 5 + 5 ability, and harden has 30 + 10 ability +10. Sorry, no team in the league, including the Lakers, can match their firepower output.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/19/29%20+%2029,%20League%20first!%20Thanks%20to%20harden,%20that's%20the%20real%20purpose%20of%20the%20nets/6ef3bea7-5fcc-47e6-af79-e2932337a299.gif" alt="29 + 29, League first! Thanks to harden, that&#39;s the real purpose of the nets"><br>Why did Griffin and Adelaide join the nets after the buyout? Why not join the Lakers, or the Bucks, or even the Clippers? There are three reasons. First, the nets are a very simple team. Simple, literally, no complicated relationship, no intrigue, from top to bottom. The simplest example is that after the transaction of harden, there was really no one available in the team, so the management quickly signed and found someone, Perry, Robertson, azley Johnson. Owen was angry and absent from training and games for a long time. After harden came to the team, Owen only asked for leave for three games because of his fiancee’s production. He played the rest of the games with all his heart and no complaints. Instead, he enjoyed the way he led the team with harden. Now Adu should hide under the car.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/19/29%20+%2029,%20League%20first!%20Thanks%20to%20harden,%20that's%20the%20real%20purpose%20of%20the%20nets/86072d22-a05e-416f-98fb-849c17b231d4.gif" alt="29 + 29, League first! Thanks to harden, that&#39;s the real purpose of the nets"><br>Second, it’s a very united team. When harden first came, he took the initiative to sacrifice himself. In the two games with the Cavaliers, harden was 6 in 14, determined not to shoot, and did not throw when he had a chance. He was proving his attitude to Owen and other players in the nets: I’m going to attack in series to make you green leaves, and I’ll make you better. Since harden led the team to beat the suns in a 24 point reversal, all of his team-mates, including Owen, have surrendered to harden. It’s not that harden is incapable of scoring, but that he knows how to tolerate and tolerate. What other people’s grievances and complaints are there? Who has made the greatest sacrifice? Who has Hadden persisted for a long time? Since March, harden has played 40 minutes per game, averaging 29 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists, which can keep Owen playing steadily, make brown, Harris, green and Clarkston eat bread, and lead the team to win. Who else?<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/19/29%20+%2029,%20League%20first!%20Thanks%20to%20harden,%20that's%20the%20real%20purpose%20of%20the%20nets/89557d94-4779-4113-942b-9341bd1d2312.gif" alt="29 + 29, League first! Thanks to harden, that&#39;s the real purpose of the nets"><br>The third and most important point. The nets have played 47 games this season, Durant played 19 of them, Owen played 32 of them, and harden has played 32 games since he came to the nets, only missing two. For a long time, harden led the nets alone, and there were only a few players around him: Jordan Jr., brown, salmete, Harris, Clarkston and cabaro. Up to now, the nets are 32-15, only 0.5 games away from the 76ers. Harden guaranteed the bottom of the nets in the regular season. Even if the lineup is no longer in order, they can sit two and watch one. Durant and Carlos are in the playoffs Owen, is there a simpler way to the championship?<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/19/29%20+%2029,%20League%20first!%20Thanks%20to%20harden,%20that's%20the%20real%20purpose%20of%20the%20nets/4d8c066c-1ce1-4c93-9984-d27750c85a87.gif" alt="29 + 29, League first! Thanks to harden, that&#39;s the real purpose of the nets"><br>It’s gone! Griffin once said: “when I was in the pistons, everyone said I couldn’t do it. Now when I come to the nets, the outside world says we cheat. I don’t know whether I can do it or not.” Adelaide’s close friend said: “Adelaide really wants to join the heat, but the heat (23-24) before the wave of six consecutive losses and their ranking makes people see no hope, the record is not as good as the Spurs (23-21), Adelaide’s temporary decision to join the nets, is a difficult decision.” The nets have salary space, and the nets have the smoothest way to the finals. Don’t blame Griffin and Adelaide for cheating. In fact, the most critical turning point is the joining of harden. Harden has raised the lower limit of the team. During this period, Durant and Owen don’t need to be pioneers. Their power can be displayed in the playoffs!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/19/29%20+%2029,%20League%20first!%20Thanks%20to%20harden,%20that's%20the%20real%20purpose%20of%20the%20nets/d6bf0073-fb75-4cb5-aca0-2671e26c52dc.gif" alt="29 + 29, League first! Thanks to harden, that&#39;s the real purpose of the nets"><br>Addu is 36 years old and Griffin is 32 years old. Their physical condition has dropped sharply. They are really eager for the championship. It’s unrealistic to say that Addu and Griffin are giants, but they must be able to contribute more energy than role players. This is polarization and Matthew effect. The stronger they are, the stronger they are because they have enough conditions to contact more things to improve themselves and the weaker they are The weaker they are, because what they lose is often hard to make up. Of course, Durant, harden and Owen have only one original intention: to beat James and win the championship.</p>
