In the second half of the NBA regular season, the eastern 76ers, the nets and the Bucks made great efforts, and the heat got into a tight encirclement. The Western Lakers rebounded after four consecutive losses, but the Clippers slowly declined, making it difficult to keep fourth place. As the first jazz in the league, although it is still the first in the league, but the advantage is very small. They were half a lap ahead of the Lakers, and now they’re only 30 meters. Jazz 29-11, Lakers 28-13 without Davis, 1.5 games, not much. Now the most important thing is that jazz has become the new public enemy of the league. It’s the kind that can beat them for one season at a time.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/09/3-5,%20the%20league's%20first%20show!%20200%20million%20people%20hate%20old%20Zhan,%20and%20the%20team%20leader%20is%20floating/aeef62f7-59f3-4f42-a0aa-f8be754ba4f7.gif" alt="3-5, the league&#39;s first show! 200 million people hate old Zhan, and the team leader is floating"><br>On February 25, the Jazz swept the Lakers 114-89. Mitchell said excitedly after the game that our goal is not just to be the first in the West. It’s obvious that the first in the West has been locked in advance. It seems that they are going to wrestle with the Lakers, the clippers and the nets to feel the championship trophy. But it was also from then on that jazz began to fall. They beat the heat, beat the magic, beat Pelican by 5 points, lost to 76 in extra time, beat the Rockets, beat the warriors, finally beat the sleepwalking green army, and lost to the wizard. In fact, these opponents, the 76ers, have the level to compete for the championship. Other teams, according to the strength of the jazz, should win, but they only got the record of 3-5.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/09/3-5,%20the%20league's%20first%20show!%20200%20million%20people%20hate%20old%20Zhan,%20and%20the%20team%20leader%20is%20floating/749c7330-49a4-4ce0-af65-f23a87cb978f.gif" alt="3-5, the league&#39;s first show! 200 million people hate old Zhan, and the team leader is floating"><br>The Jazz have lost five of the last eight games, compared with six of the previous 32. Especially after losing to the wizard, the whole team was angry, as if they looked down on the wizard. “We need to compete for the championship, not the first round team,” said ingers, who scored a career high of 34 points Coach Snyder also helpless voice: “Wei Shao blew us up, we have no energy at all.” “We are no longer the jazz of the past, we are no longer the No. 4, No. 5, No. 6, No. 7, No. 8 seed,” Mitchell said. We have the best record in the league now, we are number one in the league and we have to be ready every night<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/09/3-5,%20the%20league's%20first%20show!%20200%20million%20people%20hate%20old%20Zhan,%20and%20the%20team%20leader%20is%20floating/d8f787f5-5f5d-4f5b-94b7-b7d9fa3a523b.gif" alt="3-5, the league&#39;s first show! 200 million people hate old Zhan, and the team leader is floating"><br>You see, when we criticize ourselves, we don’t forget to put on the high hat first. We feel like bandits going to the city. We are no longer bandits in the mountains. We are regular army now. We can’t smash, loot and burn. As he spoke, he snatched two steamed buns from the steamed bread stall to eat. In fact, it’s not unfair for them to lose. Wei Shao has 35 points, 15 rebounds, 13 assists, and bill has 43 points. It’s strange that you can make the two giants score so easily. And the wizards are not weak at all. This season, the Lakers, the clippers, the nets and the Suns are all their dead souls. Why do they look down on Wei Shao and the Wizards. I still remember the question of Jen’s choice at the All-Star weekend. Jen said that people often don’t choose jazz, which also attracted Mitchell and goebbell’s fight back. Mitchell even said that he didn’t want to swear. Anyway, he didn’t fight for James. Even Mitchell doesn’t look very confident.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/09/3-5,%20the%20league's%20first%20show!%20200%20million%20people%20hate%20old%20Zhan,%20and%20the%20team%20leader%20is%20floating/13422c81-6629-40d5-9dcb-cb264d9beaef.gif" alt="3-5, the league&#39;s first show! 200 million people hate old Zhan, and the team leader is floating"><br>Gobel is still hating old Jan. “When people make fun of us on TV or don’t respect us, maybe we feel depressed, but we respect ourselves, we understand that our goals are much more than what we are now, we need to be hungry,” gobel said after losing to the Wizards In fact, no one really teases them or disrespects them. At the beginning, the All-Star selection was also gobel and Mitchell left by Jen and Durant. Jazz can rely on a favorable schedule and adequate rotation of personnel, plus they are aggressive enough to defend the League first, it really reflects their momentum and strength, there is no doubt about this, but it seems that they are too high-profile, because the League first, let them be complacent, although they do not admit it, but the mentality has obviously changed a lot It’s not easy.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/09/3-5,%20the%20league's%20first%20show!%20200%20million%20people%20hate%20old%20Zhan,%20and%20the%20team%20leader%20is%20floating/99609db8-a815-474c-a773-524e10d73692.gif" alt="3-5, the league&#39;s first show! 200 million people hate old Zhan, and the team leader is floating"><br>In the past eight games, Gabriel, a 200 million man, averaged 17.8 points and 14 rebounds in midfield. The data looks good. But in the warriors game, Gabriel scored 24 points and 28 rebounds, but the Jazz had no power to fight back. He was beaten by enbid when he was playing 76ers, bullied by Zion and Ingram when he was playing pelicans, and taken care of by Reba when he was playing heat. He lost his position under the basket repeatedly. When the opponent faces them, the opponent will be very serious, because jazz is the first in the league, because all teams want to take advantage of the first place in the league. But the jazz may not be ready because they were only second rate teams in the West.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/09/3-5,%20the%20league's%20first%20show!%20200%20million%20people%20hate%20old%20Zhan,%20and%20the%20team%20leader%20is%20floating/ece00cdc-aa51-422f-a3aa-96b5cbd77279.gif" alt="3-5, the league&#39;s first show! 200 million people hate old Zhan, and the team leader is floating"><br>If one’s ethics are always bad, he will die out; if one’s morality does not match, there will be disaster. The disaster may be a series of losses, ranking decline. For the jazz, what can really improve their hard power level is not the regular season, but the playoffs. In the past few years, the Jazz were eliminated by the Rockets many times. Last year, they were reversed by nuggets. Mitchell always likes to say the most cruel words and get the most vicious beating before the game. In the four years since entering the league, Mitchell’s shooting efficiency has not improved significantly. Thanks to his coming to the Jazz team, he can become the core of the team and grow up with him. He is still young. If he wants to see a rainbow, he can experience himself in the storm. Now, it’s not the time. The west is still the world of the Lakers clippers.</p>
