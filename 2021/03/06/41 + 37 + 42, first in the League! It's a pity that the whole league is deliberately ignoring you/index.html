        <p>The Lakers won the championship last season, which makes many teams start a new round of competition. They have strengthened one after another in the off-season, trying to beat James and the Lakers. Eastern three, 76 and nets two turn, Bucks closely behind, other teams were looped. The Western Conference Lakers are limited by the injury problem, James and thick eyebrow are injured, Kuzma is also tired and sick, but the whole team of the Los Angeles Lakers unite as one to hold the fifth position, while the Clippers play all the way to rest and hold the third position, which is quite like a latecomer. In the MVP list and championship prediction released by the league, jazz, as the only team in the League to break through 40 wins and the best team in the league, has been ignored again! It seems that they are really aggrieved.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/06/41%20+%2037%20+%2042,%20first%20in%20the%20League!%20It's%20a%20pity%20that%20the%20whole%20league%20is%20deliberately%20ignoring%20you/26628a96-396e-4225-9a07-4408e85ca287.gif" alt="41 + 37 + 42, first in the League! It&#39;s a pity that the whole league is deliberately ignoring you"><br>In the last three games, the Jazz lost 113-117 to the suns. In that game, Mitchell scored 16 of 35, scored 41 points, 8 rebounds and 3 assists. To be honest, the efficiency was not too high, and the number of shots accumulated gorgeous data. Jazz 122-103 blazer, Mitchell 25 in 14, including 3-point 8 in 1, a total of 37 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists. In the latest game against Sacramento, Mitchell scored 12 of 31, including 3 of 12 three-point goals, with a total of 42 points, 3 rebounds and 4 assists. Mitchell is the first player to score at least 35 points in three consecutive games since Karl Malone in 1993! Up to now, Mitchell averaged 26.3 points + 4.5 rebounds + 5.3 assists per game. According to his data, including the team leader’s performance, he is enough to enter the top 10 of the MVP list! But even his teammate Gabriel is ranked higher than him. Leonard, lilard and Owen, who are similar to Mitchell’s data, are among the top ten MVP regulars.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/06/41%20+%2037%20+%2042,%20first%20in%20the%20League!%20It's%20a%20pity%20that%20the%20whole%20league%20is%20deliberately%20ignoring%20you/64c0da32-cb65-448d-8f88-b33f4865355f.gif" alt="41 + 37 + 42, first in the League! It&#39;s a pity that the whole league is deliberately ignoring you"><br>It does look aggrieved. And jazz’s record this season is full of gold! The average score of the league is the third, the average rebounds of the league is the first, the average three-point hits of the league is the first, the average loss of points of the league is the third, their offensive efficiency and defensive efficiency are the top three in the League! Statistics show that in the history of NBA, only six teams have achieved the offensive and defensive efficiency in the first three seasons of the league. Celtic (won the championship) in 85-86 season, pioneers in 90-91 season, supersonic (the predecessor of thunder) in 93-94 season, bulls (won the championship) in 95-96 season, Warriors (won the championship) in 14-15 season and Warriors (won the championship) in 16-17 season. Six teams did it, four of them won the championship, and all of them won the championship in the last three times. Is it possible for the jazz to win the championship unexpectedly this season?<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/06/41%20+%2037%20+%2042,%20first%20in%20the%20League!%20It's%20a%20pity%20that%20the%20whole%20league%20is%20deliberately%20ignoring%20you/843eecb9-a63a-4bdb-959f-985537a445d0.gif" alt="41 + 37 + 42, first in the League! It&#39;s a pity that the whole league is deliberately ignoring you"><br>In fact, it’s really disrespect for them to use the unexpected surprise. Their current record is the first in the league. It’s reasonable to say that they are the closest to the championship. But it’s strange that their core player Mitchell has never been in the top ten in MVP this season. In all kinds of championship predictions, he basically targets the three teams: the Lakers, the clippers and the nets. In the western division championship prediction, he basically targets the three teams: the Lakers, the clippers and the Nuggets. According to the modeling prediction of data expert Kim dersberg, as the number one jazz in the western region, they are less likely to win the western division championship than nuggets. Jazz is a team that likes to throw three points, but in the playoffs, when the opponent changes his defense and marks the Jazz’s outside projection, forcing the jazz to carry out the singles tactics, the Jazz can’t do anything. Last season, Nuggets did just that, and completed a big turnover!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/06/41%20+%2037%20+%2042,%20first%20in%20the%20League!%20It's%20a%20pity%20that%20the%20whole%20league%20is%20deliberately%20ignoring%20you/47830bfc-92b5-4a5c-bf3a-93d24902c811.gif" alt="41 + 37 + 42, first in the League! It&#39;s a pity that the whole league is deliberately ignoring you"><br>In addition, they are not welcome. At the All-Star weekend, Jen and Durant deliberately chose Mitchell and Gerber as the top two teams in the league. Mitchell angrily attacked Jen. In Jen’s words, Jazz were never very popular, and they were often regarded as subconscious competitors, just like Stockton and Malone from the time of Jordan. After all, more than a decade ago, jazz was the biggest killer of the Rockets in the playoffs. At that time, Boozer, Deron Williams, Kirilenko and OKU were the nightmare of the Rockets fans. When they become the league leaders, they naturally become villains in the hearts of many supporters of the Lakers and nets.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/06/41%20+%2037%20+%2042,%20first%20in%20the%20League!%20It's%20a%20pity%20that%20the%20whole%20league%20is%20deliberately%20ignoring%20you/990b7ac4-983c-4ef3-bc15-f5b8a7baac3e.gif" alt="41 + 37 + 42, first in the League! It&#39;s a pity that the whole league is deliberately ignoring you"><br>And most of all, Mitchell’s efficiency is really not high. Among all the players who scored more than 26 points per game in the league, Mitchell’s real hit rate ranked first from the bottom and his victory contribution ranked first from the bottom! In other words, because in jazz, Mitchell has unlimited fire power, which makes his data look gorgeous, but the team leader limit is not high. When the playoffs come to the end, what we fight for is the ability of the stars at the critical moment. Last season, Mitchell and Murray made a deep impression on Biao, but when Nuggets overturned three games in a row, Mitchell only left the scene of constant mistakes, ironing, and lying on the ground regretting. The west, in the final analysis, is the world of the Lakers and the clippers, because they have Jamie and Caldwell. They are superstars who can control the game at the critical moment of the playoffs. Mitchell is still too young.</p>
