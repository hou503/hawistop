        <p>It seems to be the ultimate dream of every professional player who enters the NBA. If there is a chance to attack the NBA championship, no one will miss this opportunity. For example, harden, who would rather give up his two-year and $100 million contract extension, such as Griffin and Adelaide, will go to the net immediately after they buy out. Yes, the championship really has a lot of temptation, but every year only a dozen players of one team laugh to the end, at most 2-3 top salary super giant can lead the team to the end, this is really cruel. In a recent game, the wizard 132-124 beat the Pacers. Willis played for 39 minutes, 14 in 26, 4 in 6, with a total of 35 points, 14 rebounds, 21 assists, 2 steals and 1 block. Willis suddenly said some heart piercing words after the game. I understand one truth: champion, you can never define a person’s achievement but your basketball achievement.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/27/26%20points,%2011%20boards,%2012%20assists%20and%202%20breaks,%20the%20only%20one%20in%20NBA%20history!%20Your%20excellence%20has%20nothing%20to%20do%20with%20the%20championship/3b8b75ea-58c3-4323-99f3-80df7a6ac78c.gif" alt="26 points, 11 boards, 12 assists and 2 breaks, the only one in NBA history! Your excellence has nothing to do with the championship"><br>“I try to influence the game when I’m on the court,” he said. I know that my reputation and glory are not determined by the champion. I have been learning to use the platform I have to influence more people, those poor communities that lack attention, those African American communities, our financial system, our school system, and the attitude and image that we should show to the outside world. This is the legacy and the glory that I care about. “ Let me just give you an example. When the rocket incident was very noisy, Wei Shao was the first one to make a voice on the social platform wearing a Tang suit. For this reason, he was scolded by many extreme fans on twitter hot search, but his reply was “why not?” After the game with the walkers, Willis was interviewed and pushed into the rest room by coach Brooks. When Willis realized what was going to happen next, Brooks pushed him directly into the middle of the crowd. The cold ice and rain slapped him wildly. Willis was as happy as a child.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/27/26%20points,%2011%20boards,%2012%20assists%20and%202%20breaks,%20the%20only%20one%20in%20NBA%20history!%20Your%20excellence%20has%20nothing%20to%20do%20with%20the%20championship/e594e09a-3b14-4692-82ad-a9f85dd88b70.gif" alt="26 points, 11 boards, 12 assists and 2 breaks, the only one in NBA history! Your excellence has nothing to do with the championship"><br>It took Williams only 38 games to break the three doubles record of 15 times in a single season in the history of the wizard team, which is the sixth 20 + 20 in his career. In addition, Williams has four 20 + 20 (scoring + assists) three doubles in his career, which is the first in history. Williams has 47 three doubles in the first three quarters, the most in the past 25 years! And 35 points, 14 rebounds, 21 assists data, Wei Shao’s own score of 84 points, unprecedented, as for whether there is a comer behind, not sure! He is the only player in NBA history who can reach 35 + 10 + 20 level. He is only one rebounding short of reaching 35 + 15 + 20, so that McConnell, who is opposite to him after the game, said angrily and funny: “unfortunately, it happened to us, but it looks like he is playing 2K. We could have played harder.”<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/27/26%20points,%2011%20boards,%2012%20assists%20and%202%20breaks,%20the%20only%20one%20in%20NBA%20history!%20Your%20excellence%20has%20nothing%20to%20do%20with%20the%20championship/3a683f5b-3a6a-4d4a-a293-d08f78861f44.gif" alt="26 points, 11 boards, 12 assists and 2 breaks, the only one in NBA history! Your excellence has nothing to do with the championship"><br>I really don’t know how to evaluate Wei Shao. Since March, weishao has averaged 36.7 minutes per game, averaging 25.5 points + 10.5 rebounds + 12.4 assists + 1.9 steals, 26 + 11 + 12 + 2 data. The only one in the league that can rival weishao is the third brother dengge! However, Wei Shao’s three-point hit rate has increased to 37.3%, which is the highest three-point hit rate in the past two years! Why is Wilson so good at rebounding? Take a serious look at the last four minutes of the fourth quarter between the wizards and the Pacers. From grabbing the rebound to rushing to the front court to finish scoring, Wei Shao can finish in 5-7 seconds. His teammates can’t keep up with Wei Shao who holds the ball, and his opponents can’t keep up with Wei Shao who holds the ball. Wei Shao has played for more than 30 minutes. Can you say that he is old?<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/27/26%20points,%2011%20boards,%2012%20assists%20and%202%20breaks,%20the%20only%20one%20in%20NBA%20history!%20Your%20excellence%20has%20nothing%20to%20do%20with%20the%20championship/8d35272b-4775-415b-a9d2-bf73cc99bc14.gif" alt="26 points, 11 boards, 12 assists and 2 breaks, the only one in NBA history! Your excellence has nothing to do with the championship"><br>Of course, you can’t expect him to play like this every game, otherwise he will be the first player in NBA history, not Wei Shao. Weishao’s upper limit is very high, and the lower limit is also very low. It is his lower limit that makes him become the present situation. Because of his poor performance in last year’s playoffs, harden was disheartened. Coupled with the departure of d’antony, harden decided to unite with Durant, and decided to inform Williams to be ready. Therefore, Williams could only submit an application for leaving the team. Only wizard, mentor Brooks and lonely bill were willing to accept him. Don’t expect too much from Wei Shao, but he will never let you down.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/27/26%20points,%2011%20boards,%2012%20assists%20and%202%20breaks,%20the%20only%20one%20in%20NBA%20history!%20Your%20excellence%20has%20nothing%20to%20do%20with%20the%20championship/7035415d-876a-4e53-bc97-9f666ecabd91.gif" alt="26 points, 11 boards, 12 assists and 2 breaks, the only one in NBA history! Your excellence has nothing to do with the championship"><br>Brother, your excellence has nothing to do with the championship! In Brooks’s words, he has been in the League for 30 years. He has never seen such a player as Wei Shao in terms of his playing style and performance! Bill is also very excited: “Wei Shao is a monster, this man is too fierce!” The wizard official tweet also joined in the fun: “you all say he’s out of breath!” Yes, maybe Williams will never win the championship, but it’s not hard to deny his excellence. His triple double record and all kinds of honors about data will also be recorded in history. Who else in the NBA will be able to average triple doubles for three consecutive years in the future? Who else will break his 35 + 10 + 20 record? Weishao represents the ultimate heroism of the individual.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/27/26%20points,%2011%20boards,%2012%20assists%20and%202%20breaks,%20the%20only%20one%20in%20NBA%20history!%20Your%20excellence%20has%20nothing%20to%20do%20with%20the%20championship/ae7a87ae-99ab-4cdb-9ded-70d76997c8cc.gif" alt="26 points, 11 boards, 12 assists and 2 breaks, the only one in NBA history!
