If you want to go, you can go. Lao Zhan tried his best"><br>At the end of last year, the Lakers tried to offer Schroeder $33 million for two years, but Schroeder refused without hesitation. During the trading window period, the Lakers tried to replace Lori with pop and Schroeder. The Raptors wanted Tucker, and the two sides broke up. After the trading window period, the Lakers wanted to renew Schroeder’s contract for four years with 84 million dollars, and Schroeder continued to refuse! Some Laker fans couldn’t watch it any more. They ran to Schroeder’s social platform and said: you should renew your contract with the Laker! Schroeder’s reply: “no, thank you. When it’s off-season, I’ll sign.” That’s interesting. What would Schroeder think if Holliday could get a $160 million contract? He may think that it’s not a big problem if he can’t get 30 million a year?<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/01/Four%20years%20of%20160%20million%20dollars,%20the%20success%20of%20the%20Laker%20to%20the%20end!%20If%20you%20want%20to%20go,%20you%20can%20go.%20Lao%20Zhan%20tried%20his%20best/4c78eb6f-51b7-4b59-b448-d665d4b37737.gif" alt="Four years of 160 million dollars, the success of the Laker to the end! If you want to go, you can go. Lao Zhan tried his best"><br>Schroeder has played 46 games on behalf of the Lakers this season, averaging 15.3 points + 3.5 rebounds + 5.1 assists + 1.2 steals, with a shooting percentage of 43.1% and a three-point shooting percentage of 32.7%. Huo ledi played 38 games on behalf of bucks this season, averaging 17 points + 4.6 rebounds + 5.4 assists + 1.8 steals, with a shooting percentage of 50.9% and a three-point shooting percentage of 39%. Huo ledi’s high-level data is really brilliant. His net efficiency is the 13th in the league, his effective hit rate is in the top 15 of the guards, and his contribution value in the game is in the top 15 of the guards. His average saves and cuts are in the top 10 of the league. He is a real high-quality representative of point guard. He can project, organize, and defend. He has to find his weakness. Maybe he has a high error rate. But Schroeder’s net efficiency value is more than 70 in the league, the effective hit rate is the lowest in the league, and the game contribution value is more than 160 in the League!<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/01/Four%20years%20of%20160%20million%20dollars,%20the%20success%20of%20the%20Laker%20to%20the%20end!%20If%20you%20want%20to%20go,%20you%20can%20go.%20Lao%20Zhan%20tried%20his%20best/a125d7ec-7478-41ca-b289-3fab9e250ac3.gif" alt="Four years of 160 million dollars, the success of the Laker to the end! If you want to go, you can go. Lao Zhan tried his best"><br>It seems that the data are almost the same, but in fact, the gap between Schroeder and Holliday is too big. For example, if Holliday is the Porsche Macan, Schroeder is the q540tfsi. It seems that the chassis is almost the same, but the price gap is double! It’s very simple. There’s no way to compare your equipment technology, vehicle tuning, including engine parameters and performance. After coming to the Lakers, Schroeder’s data can only be said to be pretty good. He has never been a good organizer. He is an attacking guard, and his weight and height are weak. On defense, he can match the speed type players such as Sexton and Trey young. However, when facing heavy guards such as hollody, Paul and harden, Schroeder has no way, and Schroeder is a good defender There is no projection ability, which is why the Lakers are not strong this season, because all the burden is on Jen.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/01/Four%20years%20of%20160%20million%20dollars,%20the%20success%20of%20the%20Laker%20to%20the%20end!%20If%20you%20want%20to%20go,%20you%20can%20go.%20Lao%20Zhan%20tried%20his%20best/24ca6884-e80c-4311-9abf-d595c66ea8c9.gif" alt="Four years of 160 million dollars, the success of the Laker to the end! If you want to go, you can go. Lao Zhan tried his best"><br>Now Schroeder is pushing the Lakers to a dead end. Jen is doing his best! Like pop last year, the Lakers now leave the chance of success to Schroeder. From the beginning of the season, Jensen gave up the ball right to train Schroeder and give him the chance to brush data. Up to now, Schroeder still has absolute ball right. If the Lakers can really go all the way to the finals, maybe they can’t keep Schroeder’s 30 million annual salary. But if the Lakers stop in the Western Conference finals or the Western Conference semi-finals, Schroeder will not lose. At the beginning, he didn’t intend to come to the Lakers. He wanted to stay in the thunder as the big brother of reconstruction and live with his salary. According to Holliday’s salary, it’s not difficult for Schroeder to find a 20-25 million salary contract this summer. What about the Lakers? The Lakers either sign first and then change, and try to offer a defender of the type of Broughton. In fact, it’s too difficult for the League to find a high-quality point guard, and people may not be willing to come to the Lakers.<br><img src="http://hawishub.top/2021/03/01/Four%20years%20of%20160%20million%20dollars,%20the%20success%20of%20the%20Laker%20to%20the%20end!%20If%20you%20want%20to%20go,%20you%20can%20go.%20Lao%20Zhan%20tried%20his%20best/dcd143c1-bd0c-41e4-94c9-fb014b7967e0.gif" alt="Four years of 160 million dollars, the success of the Laker to the end! If you want to go, you can go. Lao Zhan tried his best"><br>In addition, the Lakers are only three wins ahead of the seventh lone ranger. If Jensen takes another 3-4 weeks off, it will be difficult for the Lakers to keep the top six position. That means that when Jensen comes back, Jensen needs to work ahead of time and lead the team to avoid entering the playoffs through the playoff qualification. In addition, the Lakers may encounter the Nuggets, the Suns or even the Clippers in the first round? The weakest link of the Lakers lies in Schroeder. Players like Murray, Paul and Mitchell can call the list to play Schroeder. Are the Lakers ready? The difficult Laker, everything must start from Schroeder is forced to trade.</p>
